# Diagnostics

The Diagnostics window can be used to investigate any problems that you encounter, such as hardware and scripting errors or performance issues. It contains 5 tabs: **View**, **Tracking**, **Log**, **Lua State**, and **Support**.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter14/1.jpg)

To open the Diagnostics window, click on the Virtalis button at the top-left of the Toolbar and select **Windows** \> **Diagnostics**. Alternatively, click and hold left mouse button over the Windows menu of the Toolbar and select **Diagnostics**. It can also be shown or hidden with **Ctrl** + **D**.

## View

The View tab displays information about the 3D view such as the framerate and current camera position.

### Statistics

#### Buttons

| Button  | Description                                                  |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Current | Show the current frame statistics (timings and memory used). |
| Fastest | Show the fastest frame statistics (timings and memory used). |
| Slowest | Show the slowest frame statistics (timings and memory used). |
| Reset   | Reset the fastest and slowest frame statistics.              |

#### Text

| Statistic | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Timings | The current frame rate in Hertz, the time to render the last frame in milliseconds (with time in milliseconds spent in the cull and draw phases), and how many millions of triangles are drawn per second. |
| Main viewport | Shows whether the main viewport is enabled or disabled. |
| Prims / Models / Batches | The number of primitives, models and batches being rendered in the current view. |
| Memory used | Private – the total memory (in Megabytes and Bytes) that the Windows memory manager has committed to the process.GPU – the total video memory (in Megabytes and Bytes) being used by the process out of the total available video memory. Also, the percentage of video memory being utilised. |
| Eye position | The current position of the eyes in the world. |
| Eye rotation | The current rotation of the eyes in the world. |
| Last world click | The absolute world position of the last mouse click, the user who made that click, and the distance in metres from the camera to the click location. |
| State | The animation state and whether the user controls it. |
| OpenGL context | Stereo – shows whether stereo 3D is supported.sRGB – shows whether the sRGB colour space is supported and enabled. This is the colour space used by most applications, so having it enabled helps to ensure that your assets look consistent. |

### FPS Graph

![](/img/user-manual/chapter14/3.jpg)

The FPS Graph shows the frames per second since the session of Visionary Render began. A new bar is added to the graph each second. Hover the mouse over a bar to see the FPS that it represents. The higher the bar, the higher the FPS.

### Batches Histogram

![](/img/user-manual/chapter14/4.jpg)

The Batches Histogram is an advanced utility for diagnosing performance issues in your scenes. Visionary Render draws meshes by sending triangle draw commands -- or "batches" -- to the graphics card. This incurs a cost regardless of how many triangles are being drawn, but that cost can be reduced by sending less draw commands to draw the same number of triangles. You can achieve this by merging Meshes under a single GeoGroup and GeoGroups under a single Model or LOD. To do this, rearrange your assets in the original software that you used to author them, or in Visionary Render by tweaking importer settings or applying geometry operators.

By default, the histogram is hidden. To open it, click on the **Batches Histogram** rollout. It will be automatically generated for the current frame and displayed as above. The histogram is arranged into a series of bars -- or "bins" -- whose heights show the percentage of batches in the frame that render a specified range of triangles. A full height bar represents 100% of the batches in the frame, whilst half height is 50%, etc. Empty bins are not shown. Mouse over one of the bars to see a tooltip with the exact figures.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter14/5.jpg)

In the example above, we see that there are 29 batches in the frame that render between 1024 and 1087 triangles. 29 batches is 2.74% of the total number of batches in the frame. If the histogram shows that most of your batches draw between 0 and 63 triangles (i.e. the bar at the far left is the highest) then you\'re not using the graphics card efficiently and your Meshes and/or GeoGroups should be merged.

#### Bin Size

By default, the bars are arranged from left to right in increments of 64 triangles. You can modify Bin Size to change the range of triangles represented by each bar in the histogram.

### GPU Limits

![](/img/user-manual/chapter14/6.jpg)

The GPU Limits rollout shows various limitations of your graphics card such as maximum viewport size and maximum 2D/3D texture size.

:::caution
If you exceed these limits in your scene then Visionary Render may become unresponsive.
:::

### Cluster

On a cluster, a drop-down menu will be shown in the toolbar to permit you to view the Statistics, Batches Histogram and GPU Limits for different cluster nodes.

## Tracking

The Tracking tab shows input sensor data for any connected tracking hardware in the current desktop immersion mode as well as any AR markers.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter14/8.jpg)

### Statistics

This drop-down provides information that can be used to diagnose issues with tracking. If the inputs are not displayed here or are not updating, then tracking must be disabled, or no data is being received from the tracked device.

### AR Markers

The Tracking tab of the Diagnostics window shows a table with all of the AR markers in your scene and/or detected by your headset. See [Chapter 42: Augmented Reality](#augmented-reality) for more information about AR support in Visionary Render.

## Log

The Log tab displays information, warnings, and errors. When you experience an issue in the software it is a good idea to check the log first for any errors.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter14/9.jpg)

:::note
If necessary, additional debug messages can be enabled with the **Verbose Log** setting under **User Interface** > **Advanced**.
:::

### Header

The start of the log contains a header with information about the application and your hardware (CPU, GPU, network adapters, etc.). This is generated when the application is started.
