# Getting Started

## Overview

Visionary Render provides a real-time, interactive, and immersive platform in which to view your CAD data. You can work alone, in a small group, or collaborate with colleagues across the globe to perform design reviews, rehearse training tasks, validate maintenance procedures, or verify assembly and manufacturing processes.

### Key Features

- Create simulations using animations, Lua scripts, and collision detection.
- Import large CAD datasets, whilst preserving hierarchy, naming, and metadata where possible.
- Interact with your data on consumer HMD's such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, plus numerous other tracking systems and input devices.
- Run complex models and simulations across a cluster of machines for improved performance.
- Enhance the visual appearance of your data through rendering effects such as ambient occlusion and high dynamic range imaging.

## User Interface

Visionary Render has a transparent GUI that is rendered over the 3D scene. It supports all the typical controls that will be familiar to Windows users like file browsers and message boxes, plus it can be rendered in stereo and operated immersively from VR hardware. This section will introduce some of the common GUI controls.

### Windows

#### Title Bar

![](/img/user-manual/chapter1/4.jpg)

The title bar of a window contains its icon, name, tool buttons, and standard window controls. Double-click on it to roll the window up to just the title bar. Double-click again to unroll it. You can also roll or unroll the window with the mouse wheel if you prefer - simply mouse over the title bar and move the wheel forwards to roll or backwards to unroll. The title bar contains the following standard buttons:

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ![](/img/user-manual/chapter1/5.jpg) | Show the help cursor so that you can click on part of the GUI to bring up its relevant section in this manual. You can also open it at the first page with `F1`. |
| ![](/img/user-manual/chapter1/6.jpg) / ![](/img/user-manual/chapter1/7.jpg) | Make the window roll up automatically when focus is returned to the 3D scene. |
| ![](/img/user-manual/chapter1/8.jpg) / ![](/img/user-manual/chapter1/9.jpg) | Roll the window up to just its titlebar or restore it. |
| ![](/img/user-manual/chapter1/10.jpg) / ![](/img/user-manual/chapter1/9.jpg) | Maximise the window to fill the screen or restore it down. |
| ![](/img/user-manual/chapter1/11.jpg) | Close or dock the window. |

#### Move

Click on the title bar of a window (not over a button) and drag to move it. The window will snap into place when it is close to the edges of your display or to other windows.

#### Resize

A resize cursor will appear when resizing is possible. Mouse over the left or right edge of a window until you see the resize cursor and hold down the left mouse button to adjust the width of the window. The top and bottom edges can be used to adjust height, whilst the four corners can be used to adjust width and height simultaneously. The window will snap into place when it is close to the edges of your display or to other windows.

#### Stack

![](/img/user-manual/chapter1/12.jpg)

When a window is moved beneath another window, it will snap into place at the bottom of that window. When dragged near the bottom left, it will also assume the width of the window above it - or its minimum size - and become stacked.

When windows are stacked, they can be moved together by dragging the title bar of the first window in the stack. The windows can be resized together at the corners and outer edges of the stack.

:::tip
Hold `Ctrl` whilst moving a window to prevent it from being added to a stack when it is dragged below another window. Alternatively, you can disable stacking altogether in `Settings` > `User Interface` > `Windows`.

### Progress Bar

![](/img/user-manual/chapter1/13.jpg)

During lengthy operations like loading scenes, the 3D view is replaced by a progress bar over a black background. The text details specific operations being executed, and the blue bar provides an estimate of the current progress. The rings in the background spin as operations are being performed, so if they stop spinning for a significant amount of time then the application may have stalled. When done, the 3D view will be shown again.
