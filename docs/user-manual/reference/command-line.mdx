# Command-line

The normal method for starting Visionary Render is from the Start Menu. However, sometimes it is necessary to add command-line arguments to the default shortcuts such as when debugging an issue.

## Opening a File

Adding the filename of a VRText/VRNative file to the command line, or the filename of a CAD file for which there is a valid importer installed, causes the application to load or import that file on start up. A Lua script can also be specified here – it will be executed on start up.

```
C:\Virtalis\Visionary Render\bin\visren-app.exe "C:\chess\Chess\Chess.VRText"
```

:::note
Command-line arguments are case-sensitive.

| Parameter                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-alias <name>`           | Specifies an alias (or name) for this instance of Visionary Render. This is useful in situations where multiple instances are being run on the same computer and some application settings (such as window position) need to be different for each instance and remembered between sessions. If an alias is specified, Visionary Render will store its settings in a file called `userSettings-<name>.VRText` in **Documents**/**Visionary Render**/**gui** rather than using the default userSettings.VRText. |
| `-avatar <filename>`      | Specifies a custom avatar to use when in a tracked environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `-custom-config <file>`   | Specifies a custom settings file instead of using the default userSettings or userSettings-alias files. This file must be an absolute path.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `-documentDir <dir>`      | Specifies the location for the VisionaryRender folder that is usually in My Documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `-fullscreen`             | Create a fullscreen window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `-geometry W x H [+X +Y]` | Specifies a custom window position and size according to the X Window style. W and H should be specified, X and Y are optional. Using -X or -Y positions the window X, Y pixels from the bottom right of the primary desktop. For example, -geometry 800x600+100+100 positions a window of 800 pixels wide by 600 high at 100 pixels from the top left of the primary desktop.                                                                                                                                |
| `-gvxcluster <role>`      | Enables Visionary Render clustering, where role can be either master or slave. This will also require the presence of the `-viewconfig<filename>` which loads the desired cluster configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `-hidestartuperrors`      | Suppresses the modal dialogue that reports back any errors that occurred during start up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `-kill-old`               | If enabled any existing instance of Visionary Render on the current desktop will be terminated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `-net-enable`             | Enable Visionary Render networking at start up, which permits connections from other instances of Visionary Render.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `-net-port <port>`        | You can use this after **-net-enable** to start Visionary Render with a different port number (it defaults to 45045). It is normally best to use the default port number unless it is in use for some reason.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `-noavatar`               | Specifies that Visionary Render should not configure and use the tracked avatar to represent you in the scene (Note: the avatar is only available with a valid tracking configuration).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `-noborder`               | Create a window without a border – i.e. so that it can’t be resized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `-noquerysave`            | When you quit, the Save window will not be displayed if the scene was modified. Any changes are lost.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `-noroom`                 | Starts the application with an empty scene instead of the Start Room. This also removes the Startup setting in **Document** \ **General**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `-r <filename>`           | Permits the default recipe file used by the importers to be overwritten.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `-stereo`                 | By default, Visionary Render runs in mono, and will create a Stereo context when required by the enabling of the Stereo option. This option will force it to run in 3D if switching at runtime causes problems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `-terrain`                | Enables the terrain module. Note that this requires an additional license.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-tracker <filename>`     | Specifies a tracker configuration to use – config.xml represents a file in the application data directory (provided by Virtalis on ActiveWorks systems) that tells Visionary Render what type of tracking system is being used. If this option is not specified, the application will run in untracked mode with Desktop Immersion features enabled.
