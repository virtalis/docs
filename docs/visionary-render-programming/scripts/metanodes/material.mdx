## Examples

### Example 1

This script will change the opacity value (0.0 to 1.0) of the material pointed to by the variable HighLight. The HighLight variable points at the Material assembly within the Library tree view. When the opacty level if greater than or equal to 1.0 it then begins to decrement the opacity level. If the opacity level is less than or equal to 0.0 it then increments the opacity level.

```lua
-- Drag/Drop section BEGINS - Do not edit between BEGINS and ENDS.
local Highlight = __Script.dragdrop.Highlight
local Delta = __Script.dragdrop.Direction
-- Drag/Drop section ENDS

-- Highlight is a StdMaterial node
-- Delta is a MetaDataFloat node

print("Material ", Highlight)
print("Colour ", Highlight.Diffuse)
print("Ambient ", Highlight.Ambient)
print("Opacity ", Highlight.Opacity)
print("Smoothness ", Highlight.Smoothness)
print("Metalicness ", Highlight.Metalness)
print("Reflectivity ", Highlight.Reflectivity)

-- initialise the delta variable
if Delta.Value == 0 then
   Delta.Value = 0.1
end

-- get the material opacity
local opacity = Highlight.Opacity

-- update the opacity depending on direction
opacity = opacity + Delta.Value

-- check the opacity value is not beyond the limits
if opacity <= 0.0 then
   Delta.Value = 0.1
   opacity = 0.0
elseif opacity >= 1.0 then
   Delta.Value = -0.1
   opacity = 1.0
end

-- set the new opacity value
Highlight.Opacity = opacity
```

### Example 2

Simple script which changes the Emissive value of the material pointed to by the Chess_table variable. The Emissive value is defined in an array of 3 floating point number between 0.0 and .0 for the red, green and blue components.

```lua
-- Drag/Drop section BEGINS - Do not edit between BEGINS and ENDS.
local table = __Script.dragdrop.table
-- Drag/Drop section ENDS

-- get Emissive colour
local emissive = table.Emissive

-- set material Diffuse to same as emissive
table.Diffuse = emissive

-- set emissive RGB values
emissive[1] = 0.0
emissive[2] = 1.0
emissive[3] = 0.0

-- print the DiffuseMap link
print(table.DiffuseMap)

-- print the DiffuseMap filename
print(table.DiffuseMap.Filename)
```

### Example 3

This example demonstrates how to change how a texture is mapped onto a surface by modifying the MapMatrix. The MapMatrix is a 3x3 matrix which is applied to the texture coordinates of the assembly it is applied to. This is accessed using the same method as the Assembly Transform.

```lua
-- Drag/Drop section BEGINS - Do not edit between BEGINS and ENDS.
local table = __Script.dragdrop.table
-- Drag/Drop section ENDS

-- increment the Y offset position by 0.01
table.MapMatrix.Position.Y = table.MapMatrix.Position.Y + 0.01
```
