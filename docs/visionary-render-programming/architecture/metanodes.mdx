# Metanodes

A metanode is a description of a data structure instantiated by nodes in the tree. It can be considered as the "type" or "class" of a node.

It has a name, which uniquely identifies its type. The name may also contain a numerical suffix, which is its version number. (see [Metanode Versioning](../plugins/advanced/metanode-versioning.mdx))

It also defines a list of [properties](properties.mdx) that comprise the structure of data stored by each instance of this metanode. Each property of a metanode, and even the metanode itself can contain additional [semantics](../plugins/advanced/semantics.mdx) to further describe its purpose.

When a metanode is registered it can be also be given [flags](../reference/c-api/definitions/flags.mdx) to affect the behaviour of its instances, for example, the `METANODE_NO_SAVE` flag to prevent instances of this metanode from being written to a file during a save operation.
