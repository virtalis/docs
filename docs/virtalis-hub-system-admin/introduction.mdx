# Introduction

These documents cover installing and configuring a complete Virtalis Hub system. The target audience is system administrators and the content is highly technical, consisting primarily of shell commands that should be executed on the cluster administration shell. 

The commands perform the actions required to deploy Virtalis Hub, however, you should read and understand what these commands do and be aware that your cluster or deployment may have a specific configuration. Virtalis Hub is a configurable platform consisting of many connected microservices allowing the deployment to be configured and adapted for different use-cases and environments.

:::note
If you wish to learn about using the Virtalis Hub and Web Viewer front-end instead, see the [Virtalis Hub and Web Viewer Manual](../virtalis-hub-and-web-viewer/introduction.mdx).
