## Job Cancellation

Click **Cancel** to cancel an in-progress job on the Job Status page. Virtalis Reach will attempt to cancel the job by halting the current process and then cleaning up any data that had already been written.

The time it takes to cancel a job can vary and is affected by factors such as the jobâ€™s current stage of completion and how much clean-up is required after cancelling.

:::note
It may not always be possible to cancel a running job. In such cases the job will continue to completion.

Click **OK** on the confirmation dialog to request cancellation of the job.

When the job cancellation has been completed the Job Status will change accordingly.
