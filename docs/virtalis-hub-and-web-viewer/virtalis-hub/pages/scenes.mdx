# Scenes

Once you have logged in, you will see the Scenes page as below (note that it will have either light or dark colours depending on your operating systemâ€™s colour mode). This is the Virtalis Hub homepage and you can use it to open scenes in the Web Viewer.

Each tile represents a scene and each scene has a parent project associated with it. Scenes are created by publishing projects in  Virtalis Hub. The tiles show the name of the scene and date and time that the latest version was published.

## Open

Click on a scene to open it in the Web Viewer. 

:::note
For more information, see the [Web Viewer Manual](../../web-viewer/getting-started.mdx).

## Search

You can filter the scenes by name using the search bar at the top right of the page. Click on it and start typing to perform a query. The search results list will update each time you press a key.

:::note
The search is case-insensitive and does not support autocomplete or wildcards.

## Revisions

Scenes will be automatically saved at times specified by your system admin, such as once per day. To open an old revision of a scene, click on the `...` button at the top-right of a scene tile and choose the revision that you want to open in the Web Viewer.
