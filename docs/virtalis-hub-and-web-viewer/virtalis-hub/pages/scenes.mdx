# Scenes

Once you have logged in, you will see the Scenes page as below (note that it will have either light or dark colours depending on your operating systemâ€™s colour mode). This is the Virtalis Hub homepage and you can use it to open scenes in the Web Viewer that you've been granted access to.

Each tile represents a scene and each scene has a parent project associated with it. Scenes are created by publishing projects in  Virtalis Hub. The tiles show the name of the scene and date and time that the latest version was published.

## Open

Left-click on a scene to open it in the Web Viewer. A progress bar will be displayed whilst the Web Viewer prepares the scene for optimised delivery and collaboration.

When possible, your scene will appear as below. Note that the scene will continue to load and that loading times can vary, especially for larger or more complex visualisations. During loading, the system performs several background optimisation tasks to prepare your scene for viewing and efficient collaboration. The initial loading time allows for a more responsive experience once you're in the scene.

Once successfully loaded, you will be placed at the last saved position if it exists. If there is no saved position, you'll start at coordinates (0,0,0). If any errors occur during the loading process, you will be returned to the Scenes page.

:::note
To learn how to navigate your scene, see the [Web Viewer Manual](../../web-viewer/introduction.mdx).

## Search

You can filter the scenes by name using the search bar at the top right of the page. Left-click in it and start typing to perform a query. The search results list will update each time you press a key.

:::note
The search is case-insensitive and does not support autocomplete or wildcards.

## Revisions

Scenes will be automatically saved at times specified by your system admin, such as once per day. To open an old revision of a scene, click on the `...` button at the top-right of a scene tile and choose the revision that you want to open in the Web Viewer.
