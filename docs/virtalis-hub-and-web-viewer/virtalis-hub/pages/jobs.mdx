# Jobs

This page shows a chronological list of jobs that have or are currently being processed by Virtalis Hub. Each job represents a data processing operation and can be one of two types: 

- **Asset** - Generated when you upload a new asset to Virtalis Hub.
- **Project** - Generated when you create a new project.

There are four possible states that jobs can be in:

- **In Progress** - The job is currently being processed by Virtalis Hub.
- **Complete** - The job was successfully processed by Virtalis Hub without encountering any errors.
- **Abandoned** - The job was abandoned due to a fatal error, which will be shown in red below the job.
- **Cancelled** - The job was cancelled by a user via the cancel button.

## View

If a Project job completed successfully then you will see a View button to the right of it. Click on this to open the Project in the Web Viewer.

:::note
The View button is not available for Assets.
:::

## Cancel

If a job is in progress then you will see a Cancel button to the right of it. Click on this if you wish to cancel the job, such as if you triggered it by mistake or it's taking too long to complete and you need to free up resources. Virtalis Hub will attempt to cancel the job by halting the current process then clean up any data already written.

:::note
The time it takes to cancel a job will vary depending on its current process and how much clean up is required. In some cases, it may not be possible to cancel a job and it will continue to completion.
