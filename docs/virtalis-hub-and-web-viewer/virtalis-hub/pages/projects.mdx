You can add multiple assets, if available, to the project. 

You can also add custom rules that will apply to the entire project. The rules are specified as JSON and can be used to change the property of any node within the product, for example changing the diffuse value of a specific material or removing nodes from an asset for security reasons. Refer to Appendix A - JSON Template Processor Rules for further information.

Once you have selected the asset or assets, click Add.

When completed, click Next to open the Share Settings page.
