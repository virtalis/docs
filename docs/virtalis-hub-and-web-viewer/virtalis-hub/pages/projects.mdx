# Projects

This page shows a list of projects, which configure how data is processed to create scenes. You can search for and update existing projects available to you or create a new project.

You can also add custom rules that will be applied to the entire project. The rules are specified as JSON and can be used to change the property of any node in the project, for example changing the diffuse value of a specific material or removing nodes from an asset for security reasons. See Appendix A - JSON Template Processor Rules for more information.

When done, click the **Next** button.

### Share

Choose the groups that can access the published scene (these are defined by your server administrator).

### Publish
