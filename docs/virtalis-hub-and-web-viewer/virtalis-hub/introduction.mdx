# Introduction

Use Virtalis Hub to add and publish new content to a visualisation or project that you have been granted access to. Assets can be uploaded to the server, transformed and optimised. Projects are also created and assets are added to them to create visualisations.

You can edit existing and create new Projects and Assets. 

Access the Virtalis Reach Hub by adding /hub to the Virtalis Reach web address. For example https://virtalis.hub.domain/.

:::note
Only authorised users can access the hub and this is enabled by the server administrator.

Once connected, you will see three icons on the left-hand side of the screen. These are, from top to bottom, the Projects, Library and Job Status pages. Click an icon to open the relevant page.
