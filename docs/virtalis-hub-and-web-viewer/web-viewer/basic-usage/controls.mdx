# Controls

You can navigate within an open visualisation using a keyboard, mouse, spacemouse, and Gamepad controllers or, if using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), by using the HMD controllers. Clicking on the help icon will bring up a dialogue box that displays all navigation modes and their respective controls.

## Desktop

The familiar `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `Q`, and `E` keys are used for navigation. You can adjust movement speed with the scroll wheel of your mouse (forward = faster, backward = slower).

:::note
Navigation with a SpaceMouse is also natively supported.

## Tablet and Mobile

If you are on a tablet or mobile device then you can use the following touch controls:

| Movement | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| One-Finger Swipe | Swipe one finger across the screen to look in the direction of your finger. |
| Two-Finger Pinch and Spread | ‘Pinch’ the screen with two fingers to move your viewpoint forward or spread your fingers apart to move backward. |
| Two-Finger Vertical Swipe | Place two fingers on the screen and swipe them up and down to move your viewpoint up and down. |
| Two-Finger Horizontal Swipe | Place two fingers on the screen and swipe them left and right to strafe your viewpoint left and right. |

:::note
The touch controls are designed for multi-direction navigation. You can simultaneously use the two-finger vertical swipe to move up or down whilst pinching or spreading to move forward or backward.
