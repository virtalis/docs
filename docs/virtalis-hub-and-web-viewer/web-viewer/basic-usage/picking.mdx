# Picking

![](/img/virtalis-hub-and-web-viewer/picking.png)

In the Virtalis Web Viewer, you can select objects in a 3D scene using the following interaction methods:

- **Desktop Mode** - Click on an object within the 3D scene
- **Immersive Mode** - Use a laser pointer to select objects in virtual reality
- **Mobile/Tablet** - Tap on an object to select it

When an object is selected, it will highlight in your user-specific colour, making it easy to locate, even in large or complex scenes. The highlight will flash, and it will remain visible through other geometry, ensuring the selected object is easily distinguishable. In Desktop Mode, the selected object will also be automatically scrolled to and highlighted in the product tree for quick navigation.

In Collaborative Sessions, if multiple users select the same object, the highlight will alternate between the different user colours, indicating selections from multiple users.

## Disable

To disable picking in the 3D scene (this is done in Visionary Render before upload to Virtalis Hub):

<Steps>

1. Navigate to the Scenes node

2. Create a metadata container called ClientSettings

3. Within the ClientSettings container, create a metadata boolean called AllowScenePicking

4. Set the AllowScenePicking value to false (unchecked)

</Steps>

This will disable scene picking. Users will still be able to select objects from the product tree, which will be reflected in the 3D view.
