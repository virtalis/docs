Immersive Mode allows users to navigate and interact with scenes using virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) devices. This feature supports various hardware options:

- Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) for VR experiences
- Select HMDs with passthrough capabilities for AR
- Compatible mobile devices (phones or tablets) for AR applications

To use Immersive Mode:

1. Load a scene on your device's browser (HMD or compatible mobile device).
2. Look for the VR/AR mode button at the bottom-right of your screen. These buttons only appear if your device is compatible with immersive features.

When selecting an Immersive mode, you have two options:

- **VR** - For virtual reality experiences. This requires a VR-capable HMD and is only available when a compatible HMD is connected.
- **AR** - For augmented reality applications. This works with certain mobile devices and HMDs that support passthrough AR.

The system displays only the modes available for your specific device, ensuring you can easily choose the appropriate immersive experience for your hardware.
