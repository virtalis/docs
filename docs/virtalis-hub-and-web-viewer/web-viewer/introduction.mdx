# Introduction

The Beta release of Virtalis Reach marks a substantial leap forward, born from six months of concentrated efforts to enhance CAD data performance and support multiple concurrent user connections. We have re-engineered Reach's architecture from the ground up, directly addressing customer needs for a product that is both scalable and high-performing.

This initial Beta release debuts our first-generation rendering system, specifically designed to handle CAD data more efficiently, eliminating the visual limitations experienced in previous versions. While we celebrate this milestone, it's worth noting that our commitment to innovation persists. We are in the advanced stages of further refining this rendering system, and you can anticipate more substantial improvements in the near future.

This Beta release serves three core purposes: to provide a clear indication of the product's direction, to showcase the enhancements in performance and scalability we have achieved, and to gather valuable customer feedback. By engaging with this Beta release, you will experience the progress made, and have the opportunity to provide feedback that will be instrumental in refining Virtalis Reach to better meet your needs. Your interaction and insights are crucial for the ongoing development, and ensuring that the final product is both robust and aligned with your requirements.
