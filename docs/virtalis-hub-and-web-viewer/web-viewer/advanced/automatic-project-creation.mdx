# Automatic Project Creation

The new Create Project option allows for automatic project creation during asset import. When this checkbox is ticked, a project with the same name as the asset is automatically created and published.

The project inherits the access settings defined for the asset, streamlining the process by eliminating the need to manually create and configure a project after importing the asset. This feature is particularly useful for automating workflows, such as overnight imports and publishing.

```json
[
  {
    "Type": "CreateNodeRule",
    "Pattern": "/:SceneList",
    "Metanode": "MetaGroup",
    "Name": "ClientSettings"
  },
  {
    "Type": "CreateNodeRule",
    "Pattern": "/:SceneList/ClientSettings",
    "Metanode": "MetaDataBool",
    "Name": "AllowScenePicking"
  },
  {
    "Type": "ChangePropertyRule",
    "Pattern": "/:SceneList/ClientSettings/AllowScenePicking",
    "PropertyName": "Value",
    "Value": "false"
  }
]
 ```
