# Installation

To run the installer, double-click on the installer executable. Follow the instructions on the installer and take a read of the License Agreement. If the terms are acceptable, click the **I Agree** button to continue. The installer will now extract all of the importerâ€™s files onto your machine, as well as any Windows redistributable files that are required to run the importer.
