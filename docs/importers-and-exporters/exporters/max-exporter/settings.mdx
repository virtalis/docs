# Settings

| Setting                | Description                                                                                         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flip Winding Order     | Flip the winding order of triangles in meshes (i.e. turn them inside out). *[default: false]* |
| Export Hidden          | Export hidden nodes. Note: if disabled, your nodes will still be exported but won’t be visible or enabled in the Tree View. *[default: true]* |
| Export Layers          | Export layers as Group nodes. *[default: false]* |
| Use Instancing         | This is an optimisation that prevents meshes and materials from being duplicated. Note: meshes using a multi-material are only instanced by that specific multi-material. *[default: true]* |
| Export Animations      | Export animations as Sequence nodes. You can export both transform and visibility tracks from Max but note that visibility keyframes won’t be interpolated in Visionary Render – the object can be either fully visible or fully hidden. *[default: true]* <ul><li>**Fixed Time Step** – if enabled, generate n keyframes per second. Note: this setting should be enabled when exporting animations that are non-linear (such as curves).  *[default: 24]*</li></ul> |
| Export Bones           | Export bones. Note: if disabled, bones will still be exported as Assembly nodes. *[default: false]* |
| Export Cameras         | Export cameras as Viewpoint nodes. *[default: true]* |
| Export Deformers       | Export skins and morphs. Note: modifiers should not be placed between or above morph and skin modifiers. Also, morph target weight values should not be locked – such as with a wire control – as doing so may result in morph meshes being exported incorrectly. *[default: true]* |
| Export Helper Geometry | Export helper objects – such as bones – as meshes. *[default: true]* |
| Export Lights          | Export lights under Assembly nodes. *[default: true]* |
| Export Materials       | Export materials. If disabled, materials will be displayed using the mesh colours. Note: there is limited support for V-Ray based materials and lighting values may be incorrect (use of standard Max materials is preferred). The V-Ray plugin must be installed if you are attempting to export a scene authored with V-Ray. *[default: true]* <ul><li>**Two Sided Lighting** – if enabled, materials will be lit with two-sided lighting. Note: this will slow down rendering. *[default: false]*</li><li>**Export Textures** – export textures with materials. *[default: true]*</li></ul> |
| Export Splines         | Export splines. These are drawn in Visionary Render as a series of cylinders. *[default: true]* |
| Export Vertex Colours  | Export vertex colours if the meshes contain them. *[default: false]* |
| Export Vertex Alpha    | Export vertex alpha values if the meshes contain them. *[default: true]* |

:::note
Scenes will be converted to metres when exported.
