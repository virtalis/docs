# Basic Usage

## Scene Preparation

Firstly, if you have any manikins in your scene that you wish to export, right-click on them in the tree and choose **Bake Meshes** from the context menu. This will convert them to Assemblies and Visuals, whilst preserving pose and anthropometric scaling, so that they can be exported.

## Export

To access the exporters that are installed on your machine, run Visionary Render, open the scene that you wish to export, then open the Application Menu from the Toolbar and expand the **Export** menu.

Now click on an exporter to open a file dialog and choose a location and name for your exported scene.

Press the **OK** button to start the export with the current exporter settings. Alternatively, click on the **Show settings** checkbox to configure the exporter first.

## Submenu

In the Application Menu, each exporter has a sub-menu with the following options:

| Option     | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Export     | Export data directly from Visionary Render. |
| Settings   | Open the exporter settings dialog.          |
