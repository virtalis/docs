# Installation

To run the installer, double-click on the installer executable. Follow the instructions on the installer and take a read of the License Agreement. If the terms are acceptable, click the **I Agree** button to continue. The installer will now extract all of the importer’s files onto your machine, as well as any Windows redistributable files that are required to run the importer.

## Validation

The installer should extract the importer to `<visren_or_gv_install_dir>/importers_x64`. When you open Visionary Render or GeoVisionary, they will search the install directory for importer plugins and attempt to load them into the environment. If an importer is found, it will be added to the Plugins page in the Settings window.

If the importer loaded correctly, it will say `Loaded` in the Status column and there should be no errors in the log.

## Licensing

Before an importer can be used it must be licensed. When you open an importer for the first time, a pop-up will appear with information on how to proceed with the licensing process.

If you don’t have a license yet, follow the instructions in the dialog to request a license file from us. Otherwise, you can use the **Import License File** button to browse for a license file to import or the **Connect to License Server** button to connect to a license server if you have one set up.
