# Design Importer

The Design importer includes the following format-specific settings.

## Tessellation Setup

| Setting                | Description                                                                              |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Deviation              | Maximum deviation value used for anisotropic space (perspective view). This affects the curves resolution of wires. *[default: 0.8]* |
| Max. Grid Lines        | Maximum number of grid lines to import. *[default: 10000]* |
| Max. Edge Length       | Maximum facet edge length. *[default: 0]* |
| Normal Tolerance       | Tessellation quality of circular surfaces (such as a cone, torus, sphere or cylinder). This is measured in degrees. It determines the number of mesh cells (triangles) used to represent a circular surface. The number of mesh cells will be 360 / Normal Tolerance. So, with a tolerance of 15, a surface will be tessellated with 24 mesh cells (360 / 15). *[default: 15]* |
| Surface Tolerance      | Distance tolerance for coincident faces. *[default: 0]* |
| Grid Aspect Ratio      | Aspect ratio of the grid. *[default: 0]* |
| Distance Between Knots | The number of additional points between knots. For NURBS surfaces, there will be additional isolines between knots. *[default: 2]* |
| Points Per Edge        | The number of points per edge. 0 = disabled. *[default: 0]* |
| Fast Mode              | Tessellate the import faster, but at the risk of generating more errors. *[default: false]* |
