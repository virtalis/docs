| Could not load file . Hoops error code  | The third-party API could not load the file |  |
| Imported , but HOOPs reported that the scene is missing some components | The third-party API could not load the entire scene, because it could not find, or process some parts |  |

| Unsupported or empty part type or empty part | The importer encountered a part that cannot process |  |
| Error creating primitive | The importer could not process the data |  |
| Faults found on body | The importer found errors during processing and will now list them below this message |  |
| Could not create visual on : model  could not be found | Data translation could not find the model referenced by this assembly |  |
| Empty structure given for translation of  | Internal error in the importer |  |
| Translator validation failed while trying to import  | Internal error in the importer |  |
| No  library node specified for build | Internal error in the importer |  |
| Visual not found on  | Collision translation failed because the target assembly has no visual model |  |
| Visual on  does not have a valid model | Collision translation failed because the target assembly has no visual model |  |
| Empty vertex list in face for  | Model translation failed because the model has no vertices |  |
|  texture item texture map  does not exist | A texture was translated but it has no texture data |  |
| Failed to open BGF  | The Division importer was unable to open the specified BGF file | Make sure that all models referenced by the scene are available on disk. |
|  is not a supported file type | The specified BGF file is not a valid Division file |  |
| Unrecognised drawmode in BGF | A geogroup in the model specified a draw mode that is unsupported | Make sure draw modes are within the supported range:FillLinePoint |
| Failed to find  | The Division importer was unable to find the specified file, referenced by the scene | Make sure that all resources referenced by the scene are available on disk |
| Failed to load texture  | The Division importer was unable to load the specified texture file | Make sure the file exists on diskMake sure the file is a supported image format (JPG, PNG, BMP) |
| Failed LoadLibrary | The importer plugin could not be loaded | Reinstall the plugin |
| Could not open file to save  | The importer system could not write the default recipe file to the documents directory | Make sure there is enough hard disk spaceMake sure the documents directory is writable |
| No license for  | The application was unable to find a valid license for this importer plugin | Make sure the system has a valid license, or connection to a license server providing a valid license |

| VRPInit(void) failed | Internal importer plugin error |  |
| Invalid recipe file | The importer could not read the recipe file | Ensure that the recipe file is formatted correctly |
|  is neither a VR Plugin nor UData plugin | The plugin does not appear to be a valid importer, so it is being ignored |  |
