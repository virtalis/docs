# Network License

Once you’ve installed it on the server you should see a System Tray icon for the application. Right mouse click on that and select Launch Admin Panel. This will launch your Web browser and request that you login. You can use the following credentials:

| Credential | Value |
|---|---|
| Username | admin |
| Password | virtalis |

This is normally the IP address of the PC running the server with: 5757
For example http://192.168.0.32:5757/
or possibly http://127.0.0.1:5757/ if you are accessing it from the server.

If port 5757 was not available, the server will incrementally try new ports until one is available, or it runs out of ports; in the latter case, the server will not be able to start.

If you get an error “403 forbidden” quit the browser and try again. This is normally due to error during the login process- check the username and password.

You will then need to click on the Import Licenses page and send the details in the Detected Adapter window to licensing@virtalis.com – you can select the text and copy it into an Email or text file. We can then generate the network licenses from those details. Network licenses are different to node locked licenses.

To import a Network license just click on the Choose File button, select the file and click on the Submit button. Check in the View Licenses page that the license has been imported correctly.

To see the details of a checked-out license click on the application name. You will then see the user, PC name and MAC address of the system with the license. Click the X at the end of the issued license details to release the license.

:::note
One thing to check – the IP address that appears in the web browser address window – does that IP address match the range used on your network? Just need to make sure the License Server has picked the correct network card to use.
