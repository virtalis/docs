# Network License

A network license consists of a “floating” license file that's installed on a server that one or more client machines can connect to. The floating license is tied to that server and by MAC address, but can be issued to any machine that requests a seat from the server. Floating licenses have one or more seats that can be in use at any one time, shared between client machines. The server machine must continually run the License Server application.

## Setup

<Steps>

1. Ensure that you have an appropriate server machine that all of your client machines can access over your network. Follow the steps on the [Installation](installation) page to install the license server on this machine and start running it as a service.

2. If you do not yet have a license, copy the text in the dialog as instructed and email it to licensing@virtalis.com.

3. Press the **Import License File** button to open a file dialog and browse for your license. If the license file is valid, the dialog will close and the application will continue.

</Steps>

## Configure

### Admin Panel

Once you’ve installed it on the server you should see a System Tray icon for the application. Right mouse click on that and select Launch Admin Panel. This will launch your Web browser and request that you login. You can use the following credentials:

| Credential | Value |
|---|---|
| Username | admin |
| Password | virtalis |

The URL consists of the IP address of the PC running the server, plus the port number (which defaults to 5757). For example, http://192.168.0.32:5757/, or http://127.0.0.1:5757/ if you are accessing the admin panel from the server machine itself.

- If port 5757 was unavailable, the server will incrementally try new ports until one is available, or until it runs out of ports. If this happens, the server will not be able to start.
- If you get a `403 forbidden` error then close the browser and retry. This is normally caused by an error during the login process, so make sure the username and password are correct.

## Import License

You will then need to click on the Import Licenses page and send the details in the Detected Adapter window to licensing@virtalis.com. Select the text and copy it into an email or text file. We can then generate the network licenses from those details. Network licenses are different to node locked licenses.

To import a Network license just click on the Choose File button, select the file and click on the Submit button. Check in the View Licenses page that the license has been imported correctly.

To see the details of a checked-out license click on the application name. You will then see the user, PC name and MAC address of the system with the license. Click the X at the end of the issued license details to release the license.

:::note
One thing to check – the IP address that appears in the web browser address window – does that IP address match the range used on your network? Just need to make sure the License Server has picked the correct network card to use.

## Log File

If you need to investigate an issue with the license server, you can find a log file on the server machine at one of the following locations:

- `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Virtalis\LicenseServer\Logs`
- `C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Local`
- `C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local`

## Task Manager

You can view the License service in Task Manager via the **Services** tab. From here you can stop and start it.
