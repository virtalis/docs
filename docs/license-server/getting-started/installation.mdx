# Installation

To get started, download the latest version of the License Server from the Virtalis Software Portal (if you do not yet have access to this, then please contact us). When the download is complete, run the installer executable and follow the steps below.

<Steps>

1. Close any Virtalis applications that you have running then select **Next** to continue.

3. Choose the folder to install the License Server to. We recommend using the default location, unless you have good reason to change it, as this helps us to provide support to you. Select **Next** to continue.

4. Choose whether to create the required firewall rules. If you leave this option disabled then you will have to manually enable firewall rules the first time you run the license server. Select **Install** to continue.

5. The License Server will now be installed on your machine. If a previous version was installed and running, it will be stopped. When done, the new license server will automatically start running as a service. If something went wrong, or you wish to see information about specific files and steps, select **Show details**. Otherwise, select **Next** to continue.
