# Installation

To get started, download the latest version of the License Server from the Virtalis Software Portal (if you do not yet have access to this, then please contact us). When the download is complete, run the installer executable and follow the steps below.

<Steps>

1. Close any Virtalis applications that you have running then select **Next** to continue.
