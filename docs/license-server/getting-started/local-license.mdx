# Local License

When you run Visionary Render or another Virtalis application for the first time, you will see the following dialog:

![](/img/license-server/import.png)

## Import

Press the **Import License File** button to open a file dialog and locate your license, which should have been issued to you by a member of Virtalis staff. If the license file is valid, the dialog will close and the application will continue.

## Configure

Each licensed Virtalis application has a System Tray icon. You can change the licensing configuration when the application is running by right clicking on the icon and selecting **Launch Admin Panel** from the context menu.

## Multiple Users

To permit multiple users to login and automatically pick up the licence information, create a single accessible directory.
By default, the information is stored in the following directories:

- `C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Virtalis\LicenseServer`
- `C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Virtalis\LicenseServerUtils`

### Custom Directories

You can overwrite the default directories with the environment variables `VRLICENSEDATASDIR` and `VRLICENSEUTILSDIR`. These should be set to a path that is accessible to all users, such as:

| Env. Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| VRLICENSEDATADIR | `C:\Virtalis\Licenses\data` |
| VRLICENSEUTILSDIR | `C:\Virtalis\Licenses` |

These directories and any subdirectories will be created the next time you run Visionary Render or another Virtalis application. From this point, the application will use the license utils directory located in this path so all users will automatically pick up `LicenceClient.xml` and connect to the server.
