# Network License

As of release 2019.4, there is only one additional installer for network licensing – this is the Server. This must be installed on a machine which all client machines will be able to see over the network.

The installer filename will look like this:

- `license_server_<version>_<revision>_<date and time>.exe`

After you’ve installed it you will need to run the application from Explorer – the installer doesn’t add any shortcuts to the Start menu. The Server can be made to start when Windows starts and can also be run as a service.

All Virtalis licensed applications include a configurator task tray icon that allows the user to import local licenses and/or connect to a Server - this mirrors the old License Client behaviour.

:::note
Network licenses and local licenses are different and not interchangeable. The Server can only import Network licenses. Client applications can only import Local licenses.

## Server

Once you’ve installed it on the server you should see a System Tray icon for the application. Right mouse click on that and select Launch Admin Panel. This will launch your Web browser and request that you login – its username admin with password virtalis.

This is normally the IP address of the PC running the server with: 5757
For example http://192.168.0.32:5757/
or possibly http://127.0.0.1:5757/ if you are accessing it from the server.

If port 5757 was not available, the server will incrementally try new ports until one is available, or it runs out of ports; in the latter case, the server will not be able to start.

If you get an error “403 forbidden” quit the browser and try again. This is normally due to error during the login process- check the username and password.

You will then need to click on the Import Licenses page and send the details in the Detected Adapter window to licensing@virtalis.com – you can select the text and copy it into an Email or text file. We can then generate the network licenses from those details. Network licenses are different to node locked licenses.

To import a Network license just click on the Choose File button, select the file and click on the Submit button. Check in the View Licenses page that the license has been imported correctly.

To see the details of a checked-out license click on the application name. You will then see the user, PC name and MAC address of the system with the license. Click the X at the end of the issued license details to release the license.

:::note
One thing to check – the IP address that appears in the web browser address window – does that IP address match the range used on your network? Just need to make sure the License Server has picked the correct network card to use.

If you want to run the License Server as a Windows Service, you need to do the following from a CMD window.
C:\Windows\system32>sc create "VirtalisLicenseServer" binpath= "C:\Virtalis\Virtalis License Server\bin\virtalis_license_server.exe -service"
Using the default system user means the logs will be written here:

C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Virtalis\LicenseServer\Logs
Or
C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Local
Or
C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local
Or if not running as service
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Virtalis\LicenseServer\Logs
The Service can be viewed in Task Manager using the Services tab. From here it can be stopped and started.
