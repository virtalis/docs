# Multiple Users

To permit multiple users to login and automatically pick up the licence information, create a single accessible directory.
By default, the information is stored in the following directories:

- `C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Virtalis\LicenseServer`
- `C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Virtalis\LicenseServerUtils`

You can overwrite the default directories with the environment variables `VRLICENSEDATASDIR` and `VRLICENSEUTILSDIR`. These should be set to a path that is accessible to all users, such as:

| Env. Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| VRLICENSEDATADIR | `C:\Virtalis\Licenses\data` |
| VRLICENSEUTILSDIR | `C:\Virtalis\Licenses` |

When you next start Visionary Render, the folder is created with its subfolders. Visionary Render now uses the licenceutils directory located in this path so all users will automatically pick up the `LicenceClient.xml` and connect to the server.
