# Local License

Upon running Visionary Render of another Virtalis application for the first time, you will see the following dialog:

![](/img/license-server/view.png)

Click Import License File, which will open a file dialog to find the license â€“ this should have been issued to you by a member of Virtalis staff. If the license file is valid, the dialog will close and the application will continue.

Each licensed Virtalis application has a System Tray icon. The licensing configuration can be changed at any time the application is running by right click on the icon and select Launch Admin Panel.
