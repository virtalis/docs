# Introduction

The license server manages network licenses for our native applications. It runs in the background as a service and permits licenses to be imported and managed via a web interface.

## Types of License

There are two types of license that applications can use.

### Local

A local license is a license file tied to a single machine by MAC address. It is stored on the machine that will be running the software and does not require you to install the license server or have a network connection.

### Network

A network license consists of a “floating” license file that's installed on a server that one or more client machines can connect to. The floating license is tied to that server and by MAC address, but can be issued to any machine that requests a seat from the server. Floating licenses have one or more seats that can be in use at any one time, shared between client machines. The server machine must continually run the License Server application.
