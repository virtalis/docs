# Gallery

The Gallery provides a categorised view of assets that can be added to your scene. It is divided into two panels. The left panel has two main functions. The first is to allow you to browse existing assets and add them to the Scenes tree. The second is to allow you to group a selection of assets together and save them into a collection. The right panel provides a preview of currently selected assets.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/overview.png)

To open the Gallery, click on the Virtalis button at the top-left of the Toolbar and select **Windows** > **Gallery**. Alternatively, click and hold left mouse button over the Windows menu of the Toolbar and select **Gallery**. It can also be shown or hidden with **Ctrl** + **G**.

## Navigation Buttons

The ![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/prev.png) and ![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/next.png) buttons at the top-left of the window navigate backwards and forwards through the selection history.

## Browse Tab

The Gallery will display the Browse tab when it is first shown. Its primary purpose is to organise and display all the assets in the gallery folders. The Browse tab has two viewing modes: Category and Folder. These viewing modes can be chosen from the **Mode** drop-down menu located in the toolbar.

### Category Mode

The category mode displays assets grouped by their type and category and serves as the primary interface for browsing and adding assets to the scene.

#### Types and Categories

When an asset is added to the gallery it is automatically assigned a category based on its content. For example, a sound file would be categorised under ‘Audio’, and a model would be categorised under ‘Component’. These initial categories are designed to help you organise and locate assets in the gallery more easily and are read-only.

To remove a category, right-click on its icon and select **Remove Category** from the context menu.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/remove-category.png)

Select a category or type icon to preview its contents and show information about the number of assets it contains in the right-hand panel. The image below shows an example of the preview generated for the contents of the Components category.

#### Favourites

The Gallery permits you to bookmark your favourite categories so that you can access them more easily. There are 2 ways to do this:

1. Right-click on a category and select **Add to favourites** from the context menu.
2. Hover the cursor over a category until a star appears at the top-left of the icon. Click on the icon to add the category to your favourites. Note: In the list views, this icon will appear in a column of the list instead.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/favourite.png)

#### Searching

At the top of the Browse tab is the search bar. The search bar can be used to find assets by name and category. To search for an asset by name, simply type the search text into the search bar, using quotation marks to encapsulate spaces. Any assets in the gallery that match the name will be show in the asset view. An example of searching by name can be seen below.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/search-by-name.png)

To search for assets by category you must prefix the name you’re searching for with the hash symbol. As with searching for assets by name, if the category name contains a space the entire search string must be encapsulated by quotation marks. As soon as you type a hash symbol into the text box the search bar will attempt to autocomplete your search for you by listing all matching types and categories underneath. An example of this can be seen below.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/search-by-category.png)

To search for an asset using multiple search terms, a space must separate each term. An example of an asset being searched for using a mixture of names and categories can be seen below.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/search-by-mix.png)

#### Preview

If a category icon is double-clicked, all gallery assets that match the category will be shown in the left-hand panel. Selecting individual gallery assets will display a pre-rendered preview image of the asset alongside detailed metadata relating to the asset type and a list of the categories it belongs to. To enable a real-time and interactive preview of the asset, click on the **Show Live Preview** button.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/cascade.png)

The ![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/prev.png) and ![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/next.png) buttons at the sides of the preview navigate to the previous or next item in a directory.

##### Preview Modes

When there are multiple assets in a category, the preview mode drop-down menu will be shown at the top-left of the panel. It has 4 options:
| Image | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/cascade.png) | **Cascade**<br/>Overlay all the assets in a category from the top-left to bottom-right of the preview panel. |
| ![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/tile.png) | **Tile**<br/>Organise the assets in a category as tiles. |
| ![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/first.png) | **First**<br/>Only show the first asset in a category. |
| ![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/last.png) | **Last**<br/>Only show the last asset in a category. |

#### Editing Assets

To edit assets in the Browse view, right-click on them to bring up the context menu.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/edit.png)

The context menu options permit the following actions to be performed on an asset:

| Option              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Alternatively, a selected asset can be added to the scene by pressing the **Add to Scene** button at the bottom-right of the window.

### Folder Mode

The folder mode displays assets as they are stored on the hard disk and allows for files to be viewed, copied, renamed, and deleted. By default, it will show the contents of your **Personal** assets folder, which can be found in **Documents**/**VisionaryRender**/**Gallery**.

Any compatible asset files in the directories listed under the **Folders** root directory will be indexed and added to the gallery. This can include your VRCollection files but also files in all the media file formats that the gallery supports.

#### Adding/Removing Asset Folders

While in Folder Mode the gallery interface allows for additional directories to be added as asset source folders. Located at the bottom-left of the gallery frame are 4 buttons that are included for the management of asset folders.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/icons.png)

| Button        | Description                                                                                                                                               |

#### Preview

To preview the contents of a file, simply click on the icon. If the file is a VRCollection the preview panel will display pre-rendered images of the contents, relevant metadata, and the path to its location on disk. The image below shows an example of the type of metadata that is displayed when a VRCollection file is selected.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/preview1.png)

Double-click on a VRCollection file to display the individual assets that it contains and allow them to be interacted with and added to your scene. The image below shows an example of the contents of PrimitiveShapes.VRCollection.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/preview2.png)

## Create Tab

The create tab is used to create and save collections of scene assets into the gallery. An example of the create tab displaying a single asset item can be seen below.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/create.png)

### Creating a Collection

There are 3 ways to add an asset to a collection:

1. Select nodes in the Scenes tree, right-click on them and select **Save to Gallery** from the context menu.
2. Select nodes in the Scenes tree and drag them into the empty area of the **Create** tab in the Gallery window.
3. Select nodes in the 3D scene and drag them into the empty area of the **Create** tab in the Gallery window.

By default, when an asset node is dragged into the Create tab its dependencies will be saved within the collection but will not be visible as individual assets in the gallery. To ensure that the asset’s dependencies are visible in the gallery as individual components, the **Shift** key should be held whilst dragging the node into the create tab. The image below shows the result of dragging a cube primitive into the create tab with the **Shift** key held down.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/single.png)

When multiple nodes are dragged into the create tab it is possible to combine all the assets into a single gallery item by holding the **Ctrl** key whilst dragging the assets into the create tab. An example of this can be seen below.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/multiple.png)

Once assets have been added to the create tab they can be saved into a collection using the **Save All** button located at the bottom of the left panel. Conversely, all the assets added to the create tab can be removed by pressing the **Discard All** button. Individual assets can be saved or discarded by selecting one or more items in the create tab and pressing the **Save Selected** or **Discard Selected** buttons that will appear at the bottom of the create tab.

### Editing Properties and Metadata

Before saving assets into a collection, there are a variety of different types of metadata that you can add to the asset to help organise them once they’re added to the gallery. The ability to add and edit asset metadata is accessed via the context menu that appears after right-clicking on one or more assets in the Create tab.

![](/img/visren/user-manual/windows/gallery/edit-properties.png)

The context menu options permit the following actions to be performed on a gallery asset:

| Option              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
