# Review

The Review window permits you to view and edit annotations, which are markers that can be added to objects in your scene to highlight points of interest. Annotations can be used to display text and load viewpoints and snapshots.

To open the Review window, click on the Virtalis button at the top-left of the Toolbar and select **Windows** > **Review**. Alternatively, click and hold left mouse button over the Windows menu of the Toolbar and select **Review**. It can also be shown or hidden with **Ctrl** + **B**.

## Annotation Tool

The annotation tool permits you to add annotations to objects in your scene by clicking on them.

### Enable

The annotation tool can be enabled or disabled from the ![](/img/user-manual/chapter16/2.jpg) button in the Toolbar or by pressing **Ctrl** + **3**. When enabled, the Review window will be shown, and a note icon will be added to the stereo cursor.

### Create

With the annotation tool enabled, click on an object in the scene to add an annotation to it. A marker will be created at that spot and the Review window will show the details of the new annotation, which is named after the object it was attached to. The annotation node will be added to the Scenes tree under Annotations.

## Annotation Navigator

The Annotation Navigator rollout permits you to select an annotation to view in the Review window and 3D view. It can also be used to enable, disable, or delete the current annotation.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter16/5.jpg)

The current annotation is shown in the combo box at the centre of the rollout. When you have multiple annotations in your scene, you can click in the box to change the current annotation. The current annotation will be shown in the Review window and 3D view.

| ![](/img/user-manual/chapter16/12.jpg) | Teleport to the next annotation in the scene.     |

## Viewpoints

When an annotation is created, a default viewpoint will be automatically generated by capturing the current view. This viewpoint will be loaded when setting the current annotation in the Review window.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter16/13.jpg)

Click on the **Add Viewpoint** button to add another viewpoint to your annotation – the current view in the scene will be captured. The new viewpoint will be shown below the Other Viewpoints header. Click on the radio button over its preview to set it as the default viewpoint or the cross button to delete it.

If something changes in your scene – for instance, an object is removed – then you can click on the **Recapture Viewpoints** button to update the preview textures of all the viewpoints in the current annotation.

## Comments

Comments can be added to the annotation to display text in the scene.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter16/14.jpg)

Click on the **Add Comment** button to add a new comment to the annotation. The default text can now be edited in the text edit box. Click on the **Toggle Visibility** button to show or hide comments and the cross button to delete a comment.

:::note
You can have more than one comment – they will appear beneath each other in the scene.
:::

## Snapshots

Annotations can trigger snapshots, which store the states of objects in the scene such as their position and visibility. A different snapshot can be triggered when entering or leaving the default viewpoint of an annotation.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter16/15.jpg)

To set the enter and leave snapshots, drag-and-drop snapshots from the Browser or click on the link pickers to search for an appropriate snapshot.

## User Styles

User Styles permit you to change the appearance of the annotation markers and comments that you create. They can be found in the Developer tree under **Scenes** > **Annotations** > **UserStyles**.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter16/16.jpg)

### Annotation Handle Colour

The annotation handle colour is a standard material that is applied to the annotation marker. At a basic level, you can just edit the Colour property to change the colour of the annotation marker, but there are many other properties that can be edited – see [Textures and Materials](../3d-view/textures-and-materials.mdx).
