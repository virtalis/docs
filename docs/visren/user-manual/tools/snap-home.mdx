# Snap Home

The Snap Home option is a manipulation aid that returns an Assembly back to its original position and orientation when it is moved near its original position.

It can be enabled from the ![](/img/visren/user-manual/tools/snap-home/snap-home.png) button in the Toolbar or by pressing `F4` (it is disabled by default).

| Image | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ![](/img/visren/user-manual/tools/snap-home/default.png) | The snap home tool works with an assembly which is moved either with the mouse, SpaceMouse or tracked device. |
| ![](/img/visren/user-manual/tools/snap-home/near.png) | As it moves from its original location, a green ghost version is left in its place. If you release the assembly – either with the right mouse button or tracker device – the assembly will snap back to its original location. |
| ![](/img/visren/user-manual/tools/snap-home/far.png) | If the distance between original location and current location is greater than Snap Home distance, then the ghost version turns red. If you release the assembly while the ghost version is red, then it remains at that location and the ghost version is removed. If the assembly is moved back to within the Snap Home distance, then a green ghost version appears, and you can release it to have it snap back to its original location. This can be configured from the Settings window under **Tools** > **Snap Home**. |

## Settings

The Snap Home settings can be found under **Settings** > **Tools** > **Snap Home**.
