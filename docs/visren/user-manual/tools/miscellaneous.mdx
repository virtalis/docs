## Automatic Change Recorder

The automatic change recorder can be enabled from the ![](/img/user-manual/chapter11/19.jpg) button in the Toolbar. It permits you to save any property changes that you make to a scene without having a developer license on your machine. First open the scene that you wish to edit and ensure that the tool is enabled in the Toolbar. Now change the property value of a node in the Scenes tree, such as an Assembly - the modified node will be added to a new Group, as shown in the image below.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter11/20.jpg)

You can now save your scene as an overlay, and a Snapshot will be automatically taken of the current state of the Group members. To reload your property changes in future, open the original scene, then open the overlay.

:::note
The tool must be enabled when the overlay is opened for the Snapshot to be applied.

If you have a developer license on your machine, then you can save scenes out as normal and leave this tool disabled.
