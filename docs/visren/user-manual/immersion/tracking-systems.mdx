# Tracking Systems

Visionary Render can be configured to be controlled from various other tracking systems. A tracking system provides a scene with position and orientation data normally based on your head and hand - but not limited to that. The software can then utilise that data to render the 3D scene for a HMD, ActiveWall or ActiveCube.

Visionary Render can be configured to work with various tracking systems such as Polhemus Liberty and Patriot, Intersense IS900, LEAP Motion, Cyberglove, 5DT, Vicon, and ART. It can also communicate with many other devices using VRPN.

It can be configured to work with input devices attached to the tracking system such as Intersense Wand, ART FlyStick, Vicon Apex, Xbox GamePad, and DirectInput Joysticks and GamePads.
