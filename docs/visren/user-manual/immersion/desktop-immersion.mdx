# Desktop Immersion

Desktop Immersion is built into Visionary Render as standard. It provides out of the box, configuration-free integration with consumer VR systems including:

- Meta Quest 2
- Oculus Rift, Rift S, tracking (software version 1.3 or above)
- HTC Vive, HMD Vive Pro or Valve Index HMD, Lighthouse tracking, pointers (SteamVR version 1.0 or above)
- zSpace (software version 3.1 or above)
- Windows Mixed Reality HMD, Windows MR Portal (SteamVR version 1.0 or above)
- Microsoft HoloLens 2

:::note
HoloLens 2 support was added in the 2021.3 release and the original HoloLens is no longer supported as of this release.
:::

The current mode can be set from the Desktop Immersion menu in the Toolbar.

Enabling one of the Desktop Immersion modes requires the device to be connected to your computer and configured per the manufacturer's directions. Switching between modes will automatically connect to, and initialise, the requested device.

Switching between Desktop Immersion modes automatically reconfigures the view configuration and avatar as required. Note that you can overwrite the default avatar used by each Desktop Immersion mode via the **Tracking** > **Configuration** > **Avatar** setting.

When using Oculus or SteamVR modes, the Viewport button becomes available to toggle the mirroring of the HMD view on the main desktop display. Turning this off can improve performance in the headset.

## OpenXR

OpenXR is a new immersive mode in 2023.1 that currently supports the following runtimes:

- Oculus
- Windows Mixed Reality
- HTC Vive

:::note
SteamVR is not currently supported. Other runtimes not listed may still work but we can't make any guarantees.
:::

To use any OpenXR-compatible headset with Visionary Render, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the headset is turned on and connected to the PC, and OpenXR mode is enabled.
2. Launch Visionary Render in standard desktop mode (i.e. no **-viewConfig** or **-tracker** parameters).
3. Open a scene and select the **OpenXR** option from the Desktop Immersion menu in the Toolbar.
4. The headset will now initialise.
5. There are no other settings. The application will remember the display mode and above settings at exit and will start up with **OpenXR** mode enabled automatically from now on.

:::note
If input for your controller or device is awkward or not working, get in touch with us and we can fix it using the bindings in data/openxr/actionBindings.json. We have no way to know nor test the proper bindings for all devices in advance.

7. If you need to reconnect at any time you can do so by pressing the Reconnect button on the connection status window. If a loss of connection is detected then Visionary Render will automatically try to reconnect to the HoloLens. ![](/img/visren/user-manual/immersion/desktop/dialog.png)
