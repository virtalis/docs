## SteamVR Controller Bindings

You can change the controls for devices that use SteamVR (such as HTC Vive, Valve Index and Windows Mixed Reality) via Steam's binding user interface. To access this menu, run Visionary Render and enable SteamVR tracking. In the **Settings** window, navigate to **Button Map** > **Button Events** and click the **Open SteamVR Bindings** button. Alternatively, this can be accessed in the SteamVR application by selecting **Settings** > **Controllers** > **Manage Controller Bindings** > **Edit This Binding** or **Settings** > **Show Advanced Settings** > **Controllers** > **Show Old Binding UI**.

If Visionary Render is running, you should be able to select **Visionary Render** from the list of applications that SteamVR has found. If you select **Visionary Render** you should be able to see the following screen:

You can now press the **Edit** button to change the default bindings, as below.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter22/8.jpg)

From here, each button can be reassigned to perform different functions within Visionary Render. To edit a button binding, hover your mouse over the button's dialogue box and press the pen icon. You can also add multiple functions to a button via the plus icon at the top right of each input.

| Actions | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Select | Select objects or GUI options pointed to by the laser.Hold and drag a selected object to move it. |
| Context | Show or hide the context menu (equivalent to right-click on the mouse). |
| Redo | Revert your previous Undo. |
| Undo | Revert your previous change. |
| Toggle Laser | Enable/disable the laser pointers on the controllers. |
| Toggle PRS | Cycle to the next PRS manipulator mode when you have an object selected. |
| Grab | Hold this button on one controller to navigate within the scene â€“ moving and rotating the scene with your hand.Hold this button on both controllers and bring them together to decrease the scale of the scene or away from each other to increase the scale.Hold this button while using the Immersive GUI to scroll the current window (equivalent to the middle button on the mouse). |
| Scale Reset | While scaling scenes using the Grab command, use this action to reset the scale to 1:1. |
| Blink | Hold to see the teleport arc, release to teleport to target. |
| Fly | Enables navigation within the scene by pushing or turning the controller in the direction you wish to fly. |
| Immersive GUI | Brings up the main GUI window |
| Forward | Move forwards in the direction that the controller is pointing. |
| Backward | Move backwards in the direction that the controller is pointing. |
| Down | Move down relative to the controller. |
| Up | Move up relative to the controller. |
| Left | Move left relative to the controller. |
| Right | Move right relative to the controller. |

The remaining options, labelled **Button** followed by a number, have no standardised action but can be used by event handlers in a Visionary Render scene.

If you do not wish to use the SteamVR controller bindings, e.g. to support a scene from an older version of Visionary Render, open the **Settings** window, navigate to **Tracking** > **Configuration** and disable **Use Steam Controller Binding**. You may need to restart Visionary Render before this takes effect.

:::note
If the controls do not work and the SteamVR window shows **Now Playing visren-app** instead of **Now Playing Visionary Render** (and you have not disabled the **Use Steam Controller Binding** option), restart Visionary Render and/or SteamVR.
