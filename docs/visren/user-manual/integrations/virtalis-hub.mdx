# Virtalis Hub

Visionary Render permits you to upload your scenes to Virtalis Hub so that you can collaborate with others. To view scenes stored on Virtalis Hub, you can either download them directly to Visionary Render or open them in the Web Viewer in your browser.

The Web Viewer only supports static geometry at the moment and has a simplified renderer suitable for browsers, so your scenes may look quite different and be missing functionality such as animations, manikins and splines.
