# Start Room

When Visionary Render is initialised, you will be presented with the Start Room. This is a simple scene of a fictional room. It is designed to help you become accustomed to a virtual environment, to determine the visual fidelity that your machine can support, and to configure tracking systems before loading your data.

## Main Menu

The initial view of the room shows a menu with various options. The left column displays the options, the centre column displays a list of recent files, and the right column displays settings. You can select an option right away or walk around the room for a bit and return to the menu later.

| Option  | Description                                                                                                                |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| New     | Start a new, empty scene.                                                                                                  |
| Open    | Open a file dialog to select an existing scene to load. Visionary Render scenes use the VRNative or VRText file extension. |
| Network | Fly to the TV and display the network menu on it.                                                                          |
| Exit    | Exit the application.                                                                                                      |

### Settings

The settings menu permits you to configure the environment and graphical effects. By default, the Start Room is rendered with low quality settings that can't be configured. Click on the High Quality button to enable and configure various visual effects that are disabled by default.

:::note
These effects are performance-intensive and may cause a significant drop in frame rate.
:::

To disable the visual effects and hide their settings again, click on the Low Quality button. Visionary Render will reload the previous settings when it is restarted, so if you exit with High Quality settings enabled, these will be restored.

| Setting                         | Description                                                                                            |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sun                             | Change the time of day to Sunrise, Morning, Midday, or Twilight.                                       |
| Shadows                         | Permit objects in the scene to cast shadows onto surfaces.                                             |
| Lights                          | Turn on artificial lighting in the room (this setting is only visible at Twilight).                    |
| Clouds                          | Adjust the cloud coverage in the sky.                                                                  |
| Sea                             | Adjust the sea state (calm to rough).                                                                  |
| Fog                             | Adjust the thickness of the fog, which fades out objects as they get further away from the camera.     |
| Rain                            | Adjust the intensity of the rain outside the room. Note that this setting also affects cloud coverage. |
| High-Definition Rendering (HDR) | Reproduce a higher dynamic range of luminosity. This typically makes the scene appear brighter.        |
| Ambient Occlusion (AO)          | Simulate the shadowing caused by objects blocking ambient light.                                       |
| Screen-Space Reflections (SSR)  | Improve the detail of reflections in the scene.                                                        |

### Fly Through

Click on the Fly Through button at the bottom-right of the menu or press `Spacebar` to start flying around the room on a predefined path. `Spacebar` can then be used to pause or resume the fly through. When done, press `Esc` to return to the main menu.
