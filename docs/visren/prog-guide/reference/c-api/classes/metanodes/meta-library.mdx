## Detailed Description

```cpp
struct Meta_Library;
```

A Library provides an organisational structure for assets such as models and materials in a scene. 

As well as tree structure, this node also allows its contents to be saved out to disk as a separate VR file, which allows its contents to be shared among multiple scenes, as well as reducing the amount of data saved while saving a scene that has not modified the library contents. 

## Public Types Documentation

### enum IDX

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Idx_Archive | | bool - When enabled and coupled with a Filename, this Library is saved as a separate VR file on disk when the scene is saved   |
| Idx_Filename | | string - Name of the library file relative to the parent / scene document directory. If extensionless, the extension of the parent file is used. For example, `geometry/library` will save a `library` file in the `geometry` subfolder (creating if necessary), using whatever extension the parent scene is saved with (e.g. `VRNative`)   |
| Idx_Modified | | bool - Automatically enabled whenever anything inside the library changes. Can be enabled manually to force the library to be re-saved when the scene is saved.   |
| Idx_ReadOnly | | bool - When enabled, the archive library file becomes read-only, meaning changes are not saved back out. This has no effect if Archive is disabled or Filename is blank.   |
