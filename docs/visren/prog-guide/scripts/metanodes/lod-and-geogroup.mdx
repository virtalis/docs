# LOD and GeoGroup

Level of Detail (LOD) nodes control the visibility of geogroups based on camera distance. Geogroup nodes contain renderable meshes.

## LOD

### Properties

| Property | Type      | Description                              |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Enabled  | boolean   | Enabled or disabled. When disabled, no models under this LOD are rendered. |
| InOut    | number[2] | Distance between which this LOD is rendered (rendered when view is at least `In` metres away, no longer rendered when further than `Out` metres away) |
| RefPoint | number[3] | Local coordinate from which the LOD distance is calculated |

### Example

Simple script example which prints to the Log window details of the LOD including the in-out distances and the LOD reference point.

```lua
-- Drag/Drop section BEGINS - Do not edit between BEGINS and ENDS.
local LODX = __Script.dragdrop.LODX
-- Drag/Drop section ENDS

-- Simply prints out the attributes of a LOD
print(LODX.Enabled)
print("In distance ", LODX.InOut[1], " Out distance ", LODX.InOut[2])
print("Ref pt ", LODX.RefPoint)
```

## GeoGroup

### Properties

| Property          | Type    | Description                              |
| ----------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Enabled           | boolean | Enabled or disabled. When disabled, child meshes are not rendered. |
| Material          | vrnode  | Link to a material to render this GeoGroup with |
| CullFace          | number  | Cull face mode. See the Cull Face mode table below. |
| LockMaterial      | boolean | Indicates if the material can be overridden on the Visual level. |
| DrawMode          | number  | Draw mode overriding the values in the GeoGroups. See the Draw Mode table below. |
| BakedLighting     | boolean | Apply the GeoGroup's stored baked lighting. NOTE: The GeoGroup needs to contain baked lighting information for this property to have any effect. This is usually read from imported files. |
| ShadowCaster      | boolean | Indicates that the GeoGroup should cast shadows when lit by a shadow casting light. |
| IgnoreCoverageLOD | boolean | Indicates whether this GeoGroup should ignore the coverage LOD setting and render even when failing the test. |

#### Cull Face Modes

These modes control which faces of geometry in the model are rendered.

| Mode                       | Description                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `__GeoGroup_CullFaceNone`  | Does not cull any faces (both back and front are drawn) |
| `__GeoGroup_CullFaceBack`  | Culls back faces                         |
| `__GeoGroup_CullFaceFront` | Culls front faces                        |

#### Draw Modes

These modes control how the model is rendered

| Mode                        | Description                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `__GeoGroup_DrawModeSolid`  | Forces solid rendering (model faces are filled) |
| `__GeoGroup_DrawModeLines`  | Forces line rendering (model is drawn as wireframe) |
| `__GeoGroup_DrawModePoints` | Forces point rendering (only the vertices are drawn) |

### Example

Simple script which checks the current DrawMode of a GeoGroup and changes it to the next possible Mode. This script would typically be called on a keypress event.

```lua
-- Drag/Drop section BEGINS - Do not edit between BEGINS and ENDS.
local Geo = __Script.dragdrop.Geo
-- Drag/Drop section ENDS

-- Geogroup example

-- Simple check of current GeoGroup DrawMode
-- then change it to another mode
if Geo.DrawMode == __GeoGroup_DrawModeSolid then
   print("__GeoGroup_DrawModeSolid")
   Geo.DrawMode = __GeoGroup_DrawModeLines
elseif Geo.DrawMode == __GeoGroup_DrawModeLines then
   print("__GeoGroup_DrawModeLines")
   Geo.DrawMode = __GeoGroup_DrawModePoints
elseif Geo.DrawMode == __GeoGroup_DrawModePoints then
   print("__GeoGroup_DrawModePoints")
   Geo.DrawMode = __GeoGroup_DrawModeSolid
end
```
