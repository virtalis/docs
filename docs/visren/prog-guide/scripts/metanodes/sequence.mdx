# Sequence

Sequences are animations that can be controlled from scripts.

## Properties

| Property  | Type    | Description                              |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Enabled   | boolean | Playing or not                           |
| Position  | number  | Current time in seconds the sequence is set to |
| Length    | number  | Total length of the sequence in seconds - dynamically derived from all tracks |
| PlayMode  | number  | Play direction, `__Sequence_PlayForwards` (0), or `__Sequence_PlayBackwards` (1) |
| PlayCount | number  | Number of times to play sequence, if less than 0, it loops forever |
| PlaySpeed | number  | Scalar value to apply to the timestep value when playing - 1.0 normal speed, 0.5 half speed, 2.0 double speed, etc |
| PlayUser  | vrnode  | The user triggering the sequence playback (when playing a sequence with a body track this dictates which user flies in a collaborative session) |

## Example

This script prints the length and play speed of a sequence to the Log window and the sets the sequence to play forever and starts the sequence playing.

```lua
-- Drag/Drop section BEGINS - Do not edit between BEGINS and ENDS.
local Sequence = __Script.dragdrop.Sequence
-- Drag/Drop section ENDS

print("Length = ", Sequence.Length)
print("Speed = ", Sequence.PlaySpeed)

-- set the sequence to play forwards
Sequence.PlayMode = 0

-- set the sequence to play forever
Sequence.PlayCount = -1

-- set the sequence to play
Sequence.Enabled = 1
```
