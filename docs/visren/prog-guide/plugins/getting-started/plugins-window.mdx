# Plugins Window

Visionary Render can be extended with plugins. The Plugins page of the Settings window shows a list of the currently loaded plugins and permits you to load or unload them at will.

More recent plugins will unload without you having to restart Visionary Render – older ones (1.3 era) will require a restart. The checkbox to the left of each row can be used to load or unload a plugin.

Plugins that do not require a restart (2.0+ importers, for example) should correctly clean up – that is, they should remove themselves from the import menu, and reinsert themselves there when they are loaded.

:::note
It is possible to have multiple versions of a plugin installed. In this case, Visionary Render will avoid loading the plugins by default since they have the same name, but you can open the Plugins page and select one of them to load.

## Add Plugin

Click on the **Add Plugin** button to add a new plugin to Visionary Render. A file browser will be shown to permit you to select a plugin to add.
