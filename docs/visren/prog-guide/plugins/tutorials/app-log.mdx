# Write to the Application Log

## Introduction

Sometimes it is useful for a plugin to be able to log messages and errors to the application log (which appears in the tools window as well as the support log file).

## Registration

Native plugins are given the log function when they are initialised, if they export a VRPRegisterLogProc called `VRPRegisterLog`. This function receives a VRPLogProc which should be stored for the lifetime of the plugin.

Native plugins using the `vrtree-linker` library and its `VRPLUGIN_API_STDIMPL` macro may check the validity of `s_logFunc`, which has automatically been connected to the log function provided to the registration function.

Lua plugins do not need to perform any registration and may call `print` to write to the application log.

## Logging

With the exception of Lua plugins (which are limited to `print`), plugins may log messages of varying severity.

VRPLogProc takes two parameters, a type and a message. All log messages are written to the log file regardless of their type. Only some types are displayed in the application itself.

The type corresponds to the following

| Log Type | `vrtree-linker` Type | Description                              |
| -------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0        | `LOG_INFO`           | The lowest priority log message, for informational purposes. Does not appear in the in-app log display unless the `Verbose Log` setting is enabled. |
| 1        | `LOG_WARN`           | A warning to the user that an operation had issues but they may continue their work. Always appears in the in-app log display. |
| 2        | `LOG_ERROR`          | An error message indicating a serious problem. Always appears in the in-app log display. |
| 3        | `LOG_DEBUG`          | Debug messages, usually for developers, containing advanced diagnostic information. Does not appear in the in-app log display unless the `Verbose Log` setting is enabled. |
