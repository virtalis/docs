# Directories

Visionary Render Lua plugins are loaded at start-up, and are found in the following locations:

- `install_root/plugins`
- `install_root/data/plugins`
- `doc_dir/plugins`
- `%VRTREE_PLUGINS_DIR%` (environment variable)

> `install_root` is the location where Visionary Render is installed.

> `doc_dir` refers to `Documents/VisionaryRender` or similar (side-by-side installs use `Documents/VisionaryRender-X.X.X`).

The search behavior for `/plugins` directories is to look for a sub-folder containing a `.lua` file of the same name. For example, `plugins/my_plugin/my_plugin.lua`.
