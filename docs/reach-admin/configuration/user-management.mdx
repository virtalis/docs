# User Management

This section describes how to manage Virtalis Reach user details, creating user groups and add selected users to the groups.

Virtalis Reach uses Keycloak for Identity and Access Management (IAM). 

This section assumes Keycloak has been installed on your system and that you have administration access rights.

## Accessing the Keycloak Admin Panel

Navigate to https://SITE/auth/admin/ replacing 'SITE' with the domain Virtalis Reach is hosted on.

Enter the Keycloak administrator credentials that were extracted during the Virtalis Reach deployment.
