# Best Practices

## Handles

Handles are used to reference internal objects such as nodes. If you request a handle using any API function that returns one (`VRGetScenesNode`, etc.), you must close it when you are finished, using `VRCloseNodeHandle`.

Handles passed into plugin API functions (e.g. `VRPImportProc`) and callback functions (e.g. those registered with `VRAddCallbackUpdate`) are managed by the host application and do not need to be closed. They are closed when the callback function returns. If you require a given handle to persist beyond the end of the callback function, use `VRCopyNodeHandle` to create a new handle to the same node, remembering to close the copy yourself when you are done with it.
