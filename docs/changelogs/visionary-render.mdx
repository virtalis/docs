- Fixes issue in avatar model causing tracked view configurations from 1.1 to be misaligned in newer versions
- Fixes issue where a material with a dark diffuse colour and a colour map would not appear correctly
- Fixes issue where reloading a texture that had been pasted from the clipboard would delete it
- Fixes issue where the advanced search would not process multiple queries properly
- Fixes a shader exception when loading a scene containing reflection probes
- Fixes occasional crash in button mapping settings interface
- Fixes a memory leak when changing the audio file loaded on an AudioBuffer node
- Fixes issue where providing an invalid audio file to AudioBuffer would result in the software repeatedly attempting to load it
- Fixes issue where toggling the visibility of some frames would not bring them into focus
- Fixes issue where camera movement would be interpreted as a gesture
- Fixes issue where undocking/docking tree view frames would result in incorrectly ordered tabs

## 1.2

*Released 2015-04-30*

#### Added

- Setting to permit visuals to be shown for every sequence in the Scenes tree instead of just for the current sequence

#### Changed

- Permits multiple sequences to be opened at once in the Sequencer
- Sequences obey any constraints on target nodes during playback. Animation is retargeted to the parent if constrained to parent
- Keyframe rotations are no longer ignored when orienting to a path or target, which permits roll to be added for instance
- Animations can be split and merged in the Sequencer via the context menu

## 1.1

*Released 2014-10-24*

#### Added

- Adds option to enable a deferred renderer
- Adds support for streaming terrain
- Adds support for enabling and configuring an ocean
- Adds option to enable logarithmic depth buffer
- Adds additional controls for level of detail
- Adds support for screen-space coverage LOD system
- Adds support for more than 8 lights of each type, at a performance penalty when deferred rendering is disabled
- Adds support for image based lighting, allowing blurred reflections on objects
- Adds better automatic support for Bump Maps on materials
- Adds support for relief mapping
- Adds support for render-to-texture
- Adds VSync option to user settings
- Adds option for overlapped culling
- Adds finer control over hardware instancing
- Adds more shapes to the Create -> Geometric Shape menu
- Adds Texture mapping and normal generation tools, as well as automatic height map and normal map tools
- Adds ability to optimise meshes from within the application
- Adds a new User Interface for scene and application settings, including a button mapping feature
- Adds an improved drag and drop interface, allowing tree items to be reordered
- Adds the ability to select a single group member from its list of members
- Adds buttons to Event tables which can clone an event, and shift them up and down the list to change their execution order
- Adds a context menu to the properties window to provide the functionality of the scenes tree context menu
- Adds a "Last Click Position" to the view tab on the output window, showing the world position and user responsible for the last scene click
- Adds an option to property rollout title bars to reset the values to their defaults (as they would be when a new object gets created)
- Adds volume controls to Movie nodes
- Adds a 3D file browsing dialog for use on clusters
- Adds Filtering of snapshot properties
- Adds ability to apply uniform scales to matrices
- Adds ability to resize data columns within the browser
- Adds the ability to capture the screen to image files
- Adds a scene representation of the sequence currently in the Animation Sequencer, allowing the animation path to be edited visually
- Adds Catmull-Rom interpolation to permit smooth movement along a curve between keyframes
- Adds ability to orient animation targets to their direction of travel or a target assembly
- Adds option to rearrange keyframe times to make the velocity of the target constant throughout the animation
- Adds support for Oculus DK2
- Adds support for zSpace
- Adds laser highlighting and manipulation system
- Adds ability to interact with the 2D GUI using a hand tracker
- Adds modifier key capability to key events, which now supports events on things such as CTRL + 5, or SHIFT + V, etc
- Adds support for capped sections. Provides the ability to render cap geometry when enclosed geometry is sectioned
- Adds ability to click through dynamic sections and change the method of selection
- Adds ability to change colour and opacity of dynamic sections
- Adds ability to defer the resizing of dynamic sections until the section has stopped moving
- Adds a property to the pointer controller to allow it to be visible to all network users

#### Changed

- Double clicking in the tree now toggles a node's Enabled property, if it has one. The property window is now summoned by right clicking on the node and selecting "Show Properties"
- Clicking on a link property (e.g. Visual->Material property) now selects the target instead of triggering the sibling dropdown. The dropdown is now triggered only by the arrow icon on the right of the control
- The icon of a library tree now reflects its contents
- Memory usage optimizations for very large scenes
- Significant application performance and stability improvements

---

## 1.0.1

*Released 2013-11-15*

#### Added

- Support for floating licenses including a new set of Visionary Render shortcuts:
   - (Development) will request a development license from the license server using the -development command line option
   - (Review) and (Networked) will request a review license from the license server, by omitting the -development option
   - These shortcuts are otherwise functionally identical when no license server is in use (i.e. when the computer has a license installed locally)

#### Changed

- Improve application performance and stability
- Provide clearer access to application and scene settings
