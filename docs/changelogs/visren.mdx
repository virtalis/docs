- #8177 - Automatically creates a viewport when creating a render to texture object, as it cannot function without one
- #12815 - Changes F8 measuring tool toggle to CTRL+1/2/3 for the Region Select / Measuring / Annotation tools
- #5408 - Changes colour picker controls to be popups instead of rollouts
- #10349 - Changes selection behaviour of tracked hand manipulation (laser off), so that a trigger press will deselect anything not being held by the other hand
- #7995 - Changes the default visibility of the stereo cursors on the end of tracked laser to 'Off' for desktop immersion configurations

- #7607 - Disables automatic write-back to files in the application installation directory. Data files such as view configs and toolboxes are now written to the Documents directory with the rest of the application data files. Existing view configs in the application directory are migrated to the documents directory, after which any changes to the original file are no longer read.
- #8852 - Greatly Improves the speed and reduces the memory usage of VRText / VRNative loading/saving
- #5874 - Hides a lot of internal nodes in the developer / user tree behind the User Interface / Advanced / Developer Admin Mode setting
