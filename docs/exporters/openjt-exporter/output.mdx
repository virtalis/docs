# Output

## Scenes

The nodes present in your scene should generally be exported whilst maintaining their tree structure. To load them back into Visionary Render to confirm their structure, open a new scene and import the exported file using the accompanying Open JT importer. The root assembly of the export should match its filename.

:::note
The tree structure when exported and re-imported may not always exactly match the original. For instance, due to differences in how Visionary Render and JT store data, extra levels of assemblies can sometimes be generated.

## Libraries

Any geometry, texture or material nodes that were exported will be added to the Libraries tree. The Library is named after the filename of the export (minus the extension).
