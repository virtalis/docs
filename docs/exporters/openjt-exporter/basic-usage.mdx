# Basic Usage

To access the exporters that are installed on your machine, run Visionary Render, open the scene that you wish to export, then open the Application Menu from the Toolbar and expand the **Export** menu.

Now click on an exporter to open a file dialog and choose a location and name for your exported scene.

Press the **OK** button to start the export with the current exporter settings. Alternatively, click on the **Show settings** checkbox to configure the exporter first.

## Submenu

In the Application Menu, each exporter has a sub-menu with the following options:

| Option     | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Export     | Export data directly from Visionary Render. |
| Settings   | Open the exporter settings dialog.          |
