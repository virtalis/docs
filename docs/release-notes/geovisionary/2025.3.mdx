# 2025.3

Thank you for downloading GeoVisionary 2025.3. This release delivers visible improvements to rendering, immersive tracking, and interaction. You will see cleaner visuals in large scenes, simpler plug-and-play tracking in OpenXR mode, and more predictable VR interaction.

## What's New in This Release?

### Voxel Volumes

Voxel volume nodes now support an iso-range rather than a single isovalue. You can specify a minimum and maximum value to highlight a band of interest within the scalar field, improving control when visualising and analysing dense datasets.

### Rendering Improvements

Visual quality is more stable across very large and very small scenes. GeoVisionary now natively handles extreme depth ranges, from close-up detail work to distant terrain, without z-fighting. You no longer need to fine-tune near and far clip planes.

The old Logarithmic Depth Buffer option has been removed. Very large clip plane values are directly supported without the performance hit that the logarithmic option could casue.

### Tracking System Overhaul (OpenXR Mode)

1. We’ve added support for HTC Vive Trackers in OpenXR mode (Immersive Licence required). These will appear as nodes under [User]/ViewConfig/Camera/OpenXR when they are detected. If you want an object in your scene to move with the tracker, for example, create a TransformLink and connect it to the detected Tracker.

2. This release introduces a simplified structure for tracking configurations, currently available in OpenXR mode only. Other modes will receive this update in future releases.

Notable changes for script and plugin developers:

- Node types and names within the Camera node have changed
- The new Tracker node type replaces TrackerPRSLink
- Tracker inputs are now under the ViewConfig node rather than [User]/Inputs/Tracker

:::note
Existing custom view and tracking configurations remain fully supported without any modifications needed.

### VR Interaction Updates (Immersive Licence)

3D GUI elements such as buttons and sliders now respond to fingertip contact when using hand tracking in OpenXR mode, for more natural and intuitive interaction.

Enter and leave events are now triggered based on the tracked head position instead of the camera position.

### Texture Compression and Scaling

You can now automate texture compression and rescaling through Lua functions. Making this script-accessible allows these operations to be applied programmatically across assets, making batch processing and workflow integration easier.

### Lua Scripting Enhancements

`vrAddNodeObserver` and `vrAddMetaNodeObserver` now accept additional keys so you can register callbacks for all supported observer events. Specify the keys you want to observe and provide the associated Lua functions. This exposes creation, deletion, parenting, linking and cloning events without requiring C++.

| Node observer keys | Metanode observer keys |
|---|---|
| addChild | nodeChildAdded |
| removeChild | nodeChildRemoved |
| parentChanged | nodePathChanged |
| pathChanged | |
| renameNode | |
| valuesChanged | nodeValuesChanged |
| addLink | nodeLinkAdded |
| removeLink | nodeLinkRemoved |
| cloned | nodeCloned |

### General Workflow Updates

- **Web browser rig:** In the Developer tree context menu under Create > Media there is a new one-click setup for a browser rig. The default size is 1920 x 1080 but it is easily resizable.
- **Pivots and snapping:** Snap-to-vertex and pivot behaviour are now consistent across tools.

:::warning
GeoVisionary 2025.2 and earlier used the OpenGL standard depth range of -1 (near) to 1 (far) in normalised device coordinates, and 0 (near) to 1 (far) in the depth buffer (window coordinates). From 2025.3, GeoVisionary uses a reversed range of 1 (near) to 0 (far) in both cases for better precision.

Any view shaders using the result of getDepth() directly, or using the projection matrix, may need updating to handle the new range. View shaders using getDistance() or getEyePos() are unaffected as the conversion is handled internally, but will benefit from improved precision.

## Resolved Issues

We continue to focus on addressing issues you report and improving the quality of GeoVisionary. In this release we identified and resolved 45 issues, 11 of which were reported as bugs and 2 were raised directly by customers.

| ID | Summary |
|---|---|
| FUS-3229 | Fixes issues where shapes were incorrectly being rendered when they were turned off |
| FUS-3947 | “Update Sky to Time” option only tilts the skybox instead of adjusting it according to time |
