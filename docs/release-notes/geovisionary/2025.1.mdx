# 2025.1

Thank you for downloading GeoVisionary 2025.1. In this release we have focused on improving stability, boosting performance in dynamic scenes, and extending support for large-scale immersive environments. 

## What's New in This Release?

### License Server Updates - Security and Stability Improvements

Our license server has been updated with a set of timely fixes:

- **Single Instance Enforcement:** It now prevents multiple servers from running at once, which used to cause problems for some users.
- **Firewall Rule Handling:** The installer now adds firewall rules automatically (and removes them on uninstallation).
- **Service Reminder:** A warning now appears if the server isn't run as a service.
- **Simplified Startup Settings:** The "Start licence server on startup" option has been removed, as modern Windows systems are better managed through the service configuration, eliminating potential conflicts.
- **Security Updates:** All components have been updated to ensure a secure experience.

### ActiveMove and Large-Scale Systems Support

We've improved support for large-scale setups, with an additional focus on the ActiveMove LED powerwall:

- **Dedicated ActiveMove Support:** A new standard tracking mode specifically designed for Virtalis ActiveMove systems streamlines setup and ensures optimal performance.
- **Standardised Tracking Files for ART systems:** Pre-configured ART tracking files are now included in your installation (under data\tracking\art\targets) for use with ART DTrack3 software. These targets feature standardised origin locations at the flystick tip and on the underside of the glasses bridge for consistent calibration.
- **Command-Line Improvements:** New command-line options and settings management make deployment and configuration easier than ever.
- **Mirror Mode button:** A dedicated button has been added to the Tracking Diagnostics tab (previously only accessible via keyboard shortcut) to help when configuring tracking systems.

### Smarter Rendering - A Simple Performance Win

We've made a straightforward change that makes a big difference:

- **Efficient Rendering:** Scenes now only re-render when something changes, reducing unnecessary GPU use and making the interface feel snappier when editing large scenes. This new feature is toggle-able under the "Stop Rendering when static" setting.

### Dynamic Shadow Optimisation - Improved Performance for Moving Objects

Our new shadow mapping approach now separates static and moving objects:

- **Better Performance:** This means we no longer need to redraw every object for shadows when only a few objects are moving. 
- **Smooth Animations:** In our tests, frame rates doubled for certain types of scenes with animated elements. This is especially useful for animated machinery, avatars, or interactive parts in larger scenes.
- **Improved immersive experience:** Avatar shadows can now be enabled with minimal impact on frame rate, providing a more realistic and immersive experience. 

### Save and Load Settings

You can now easily restore some or all settings to a particular configuration through the settings GUI. This is especially useful if youâ€™d like to swap between tailored setups for GeoVisionary or to restore to a known configuration.

- **Settings Files:** Save and load settings using the new `.VRSetting` file extension.
- **Settings Selection:** Use the new tree view dialog to select specific settings for saving and loading.
- **Command-Line Options:** Restore settings via command line with `-restoresettings` to merge a settings file immediately on application startup.
