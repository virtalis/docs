# 2024.3

Thank you for downloading GeoVisionary 2024.3. This release focuses on enhancing collaboration, improving performance, and extending core functionality. 

## What's New in This Release

### Avatar Name Labels for Collaboration

For quick identification and therefore better collaboration sessions, we've added avatar name labels. This improvement makes interactions more efficient in sessions involving multiple users.

### Tab Navigation Between Textboxes

You can now navigate between text boxes in the 3D GUI using the Tab key.

### OpenXR Visibility Mask 

You can now change the size of the visibility mask and also disable it when using external monitors for display. 

### Smoother Navigation in Collaboration Sessions

Improved navigation smoothness in networked VR sessions, optimised for high refresh rate devices.

### Extended Image File Format Support

You can now import a wider range of image formats, including `WebP`, `JPEG 2000 (JP2)`, `JNG`, `JPEG XR (JXR)`, `PBM`, `PGM`, `PPM`, and `PFM`, expanding your options for visual assets.

### Character Controller Improvements 

We've improved the behaviour of the Character Controller with tracking systems and HMDs. Camera movement and collision detection are now based on the position of the tracked user, resulting in a more natural and immersive experience when navigating virtual environments.

:::note
A temporary height difference may occur when switching tracking modes.
:::

### OpenXR / SteamVR Runtime Update

You can now use OpenXR mode with SteamVR's OpenXR runtime, offering greater flexibility and compatibility for users in SteamVR environments.

:::note
See the [Changelog](../../changelogs/geovisionary#20243) for a complete list of resolved issues and changes.
