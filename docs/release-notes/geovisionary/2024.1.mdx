# 2024.1

Thank you for downloading GeoVisionary 2024.1. This release concentrates on two key areas. First, sharing and managing complex scenes just got easier. GeoVisionary now integrates with the Virtalis Hub, allowing you to directly upload assets and stream down visualisation data.

Second, we have focused on a small set of key issues reported internally and by customers, and we are confident that these changes will be welcomed. 

## What's New in This Release?

### Virtalis Hub Integration

The Virtalis Hub is a fully owned and managed solution (on-prem or private cloud) to centrally control visualisation data. GeoVisionary remains the rich studio product for power users and this new integration allows for unprecedented ease in sharing scenes across multiple GeoVisionary installations.

With the integration you can:

- Upload scenes directly to Virtalis Hub from within GeoVisionary.
- Stream scenes from Virtalis Hub to GeoVisionary, while maintaining the functionality of decorations and enhancements of scripts, GUIs, etc.

:::note
While GeoVisionary 2024.1 supports uploading scenes to Virtalis Hub, it currently does not include externally referenced files like point clouds. When opening scenes from the Hub, externally referenced files need to be accessible locally or via a network share. 
:::

:::note
Access to the Virtalis Hub is sold separately from your GeoVisionary purchase.

### OpenXR Improvements

- Enable passthrough mode in Quest Link (developer mode) for a more immersive mixed-reality experience. 
- You can now also adjust background opacity in both the Quest and HoloLens 2 devices for better control over the visibility of the real world behind your virtual content. 

:::note
For passthrough, the base functionality is currently in beta from Meta, and requires a developer account for access. We recommend using a cabled connection with your headset for optimal performance.
