# 2022.1

Thank you for downloading GeoVisionary 2022.1. This release introduces new features and addresses various issues reported by customers. 

## What's New in This Release?

### Splines and Spline Helpers

The editing of splines has been improved in GeoVisionary through the addition of spline helpers in the scene. Spline helpers are rendered by default and allow you to more easily adjust the shape of the spline. We have also made various improvements and fixes to tube splines and added support for gradients that show the curvature of the spline.

The user manual has been updated to include a new chapter on splines and spline helpers. 

## Resolved Issues

Defects, or bugs, are an unfortunate, but inevitable occurrence in any software product. At Virtalis we work hard to maintain and improve the quality of our codebase and resolve as many reported issues as we can, as quickly as we can. We have identified and resolved 7 issues as part of our internal testing for the 2022.1 release. This number includes the 2 customer issues detailed in the below table.
