# 2022.2

Thank you for downloading GeoVisionary 2022.2. This release introduces new features and addresses issues reported by customers.

## What's New in This Release?

You can now generate 1:1 scale manikins in a scene. These manikins can be easily posed through the use of Inverse and Forward Kinematics. Manikin bones can be individually scaled in order to match anthropometric data. 

## Resolved Issues

Defects, or bugs, are an unfortunate, but inevitable occurrence in any software product. At Virtalis we work hard to maintain and improve the quality of our codebase and resolve as many reported issues as we can, as quickly as we can. We have identified and resolved 7 issues as part of our internal testing for the 2022.2 release. This number includes the 1 customer issue detailed in the below table.
