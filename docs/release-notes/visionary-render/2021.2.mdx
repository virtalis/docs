# 2021.2

Thank you for downloading Visionary Render 2021.2.

## What's New in This Release?

### Event Observers and Custom Settings

Allowing you to subscribe to particular, or all, events on any node in the tree means that much code duplication can be avoided. This is relevant in a range of scenarios including monitoring touch/break events or press/click events on programmatically generated GUIs.

It is now also possible to allow a single observer to accept multiple inputs, further streamlining the coding effort when using the Lua API.

It is now also possible to add a setting to the user registry via Lua. This has a number of potential uses, not least the ability to set the address of an external server for Visionary Render to access.

### Show Disabled Objects in Tree

A convenience factor, but an important one. It can be difficult to see what assemblies have been disabled, particularly in large, complex product trees. It is now possible to apply a filter to show just this, allowing you to work much more effectively.

### Support for Projection onto Curved Screens

Itâ€™s now possible for you to configure a two-dimensional curved projection of Visionary Render. The approach is to apply a warp to the standard rectangular rendering at the post-processing stage. Please contact support or your account representative for more details on configuring this feature.
