# 2020.1

Thank you for downloading Visionary Render 2020.1. This release sees updates to some underlying components of our importer engine alongside a focus on addressing defects highlighted by customers or our own internal testing. 

## What's New in This Release?

This release sees Visionary Render implement some necessary updates to our CAD importer engine, ensuring that we’re tracking the latest standards across the board. From a performance perspective, we’ve also made some tweaks which mean that updates to splines with many knots now occur more quickly.

## Resolved Issues

Defects, or bugs, are an unfortunate, but inevitable occurrence in any software product. At Virtalis we work hard to maintain and improve the quality of our code base and resolve as many reported issues as we can, as quickly as we can.

## Removed Features

### Windows 7 Support

As you may be aware, Microsoft ended their support of Windows 7 on January 14, 2020. Accordingly, 2020.1 will be the last release that will routinely support Windows 7. As a rule, we are bound to follow Microsoft’s lead when it comes to support of their legacy operating systems. From 2020.2 onward we will not be testing against Windows 7 and can make no guarantees about the stability or performance of our software on this operating system.
