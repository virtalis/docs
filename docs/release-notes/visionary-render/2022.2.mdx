# 2022.2

Thank you for downloading Visionary Render 2022.2. The focus for this release has been on making ergonomic design decisions easier through the introduction of the manikin functionality. The notable new feature is the ability to create a fully rigged manikin directly in a scene. The manikin is rigged with a series of interconnected bones which allows the user to control the human model as needed. Manikins can easily be positioned into relevant and representative poses through the use of inverse and forward kinematics. Manikin bones can also be individually scaled in order to approximate relevant anthropometric measurements and datasets.

## What's New in This Release?

### Create a Manikin

You can now create a 1:1 scale manikin directly in your Visionary Render scenes. 

```mdx-code-block
<LiteYouTubeEmbed id="kWnOLA-nMFg" params="autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0" title="Visionary Render - Manikin Demo - Manikin Snapshot" poster="maxresdefault" webp />
```

### Inverse Kinematics (IK) Targets for Posing

You will find it easy to control the position and rotation of various body parts of the manikin by manipulating IK targets. When you move a selected IK target, the target and the manikin limbs will respond by moving accordingly. 

```mdx-code-block
<LiteYouTubeEmbed id="Hekq_NFs5R8" params="autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0" title="Visionary Render - Manikin Demo - Posing" poster="maxresdefault" webp />
```

### Forward Kinematics (FK) for Fine-grained Control

Toggling IK mode off, in the manikin properties panel, allows you to individually control the bone rotations in order to get precise poses and movements captured in the scene. The fingers of the manikin are articulated and can be simply controlled by default where all fingers follow a parent bone helper. Fingers can also be controlled separately at each individual joint. 

```mdx-code-block
<LiteYouTubeEmbed id="ydGcJCOMXqU" params="autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0" title="Visionary Render - Manikin Demo - IKFK" poster="maxresdefault" webp />
```

### Manikin Colour Properties

Edit the colours for hair, skin, and clothing to allow for easy identification and matching of the manikin to the intended scene. 

```mdx-code-block
<LiteYouTubeEmbed id="gJ0cFOdeqOo" params="autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0" title="Visionary Render - Manikin Demo - Colour" poster="maxresdefault" webp />
```

### Individual Bone Scaling

The total height (in metres) of the manikin can be adjusted to match a design specification. Furthermore each bone can be individually scaled in order to correspond to anthropometric data being worked with. 

### Body Segment Thickness Adjustments

Control the scale thickness of individual body segments to get a more representative model.

```mdx-code-block
<LiteYouTubeEmbed id="8A_hiKzLhJw" params="autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0" title="Visionary Render - Manikin Demo - Bones" poster="maxresdefault" webp />
```

### Constraints and Ranges of Motion

Pose the manikin easily within physically plausible and human-like limits. The ranges of motion on all joints are constrained and based on real human ranges of motion.

```mdx-code-block
<LiteYouTubeEmbed id="MVLwZ1BU7G0" params="autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0" title="Visionary Render - Manikin Demo - Constraints" poster="maxresdefault" webp />
```

### Enhanced Measurement Tool

Obtain accurate manikin measurements. The measurement tool updates with live values as manikin bone lengths are scaled. Compare individual measurements with your source data directly to create representative models in your scene.

```mdx-code-block
<LiteYouTubeEmbed id="l9_Qvo-VY3o" params="autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0" title="Visionary Render - Manikin Demo - Anthromeasure" poster="maxresdefault" webp />
```

### Adding Tools to Manikin 

Easily drag tools, PPE, and other accessories to the manikin as sub-assemblies of hands, head, feet, etc. These accessories will naturally follow the IK targets as they move and allow you to pose and arrange your manikin just as you need it. 

```mdx-code-block
<LiteYouTubeEmbed id="K889DDxUjiI" params="autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0" title="Visionary Render - Manikin Demo - Adding Tools" poster="maxresdefault" webp />
```

### Position at Body in Immersive Mode

Rapidly place the manikin at the userâ€™s position in the scene while retaining any IK or FK pose adjustments that have been made. 

```mdx-code-block
<LiteYouTubeEmbed id="s-uajdPrP0Y" params="autoplay=1&autohide=1&showinfo=0&rel=0" title="Visionary Render - Manikin Demo - Position at Body" poster="maxresdefault" webp />
```

### Directional Light Helper

The directional light helper has been changed to clearly demonstrate the direction of the light. The user manual has been updated to show the new helper. 

### User Manual 

The user manual has been updated to include a new chapter on manikins and manikin helpers. The chapter includes tips and examples of how to easily pose the manikin.

## Known Limitations

- **Manikin animation:** In the current release, while both bone and target nodes can be added to the animation sequencer, only targets can be animated. This method may give unreliable results and is best used for uncomplicated animations.
