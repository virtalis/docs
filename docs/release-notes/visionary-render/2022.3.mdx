# 2022.3

Thank you for downloading Visionary Render 2022.3. The focus for this release has been three-fold, first we have implemented a new method to improve scene performance where there are high numbers of small meshes. Second, we have taken on some feedback and put emphasis on issues reported by customers. High priority issues which may have caused crashes with the animation sequencer have been covered, as well as various fixes which will improve customer experience and workflow have been implemented. Third, the importer libraries have been updated and new version support is reflected in a table below.

## What's New in This Release?

### Render Performance

In this release we have improved the rendering performance for scenes which contain many thousands of small meshes. Visionary Render is now able to more fully utilise the capability of high-end GPUs without requiring complex CAD data to be simplified. Depending on the nature of your scene and hardware this can more than double the frame rate in some cases, compared to Visionary Render 2022.2.

### Snap Rotation

There is a new option under navigation settings to enable snap rotate in immersive mode. This comfort setting is a movement style which may reduce motion sickness for sensitive users (Settings>Navigation>Immersive Snap Rotation).

### Collaboration Connection Speed

The data sent and received over the network for users who already have the scene open has been reduced and the connection process is now much faster.
