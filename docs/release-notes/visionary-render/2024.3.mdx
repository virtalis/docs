# 2024.3

Thank you for downloading Visionary Render 2024.3. This release focuses on enhancing collaboration, improving performance, and extending core functionality based on your feedback. 

The new features and improvements in this release will positively impact your overall experience with Visionary Render.

## What's New in This Release?

### Introducing the JT Exporter

We're pleased to introduce our new JT format exporter. This capability enhances collaborative workflows and communication. It helps address challenges in sharing complex visualisations and design modifications and getting meaningful stakeholder engagement across your business.

#### Key Benefits

- Export Visionary Render models directly to JT format for easy import into PLM systems like Siemens Teamcenter, and various MCAD software tools.
- Share modifications with team members who donâ€™t have access to Visionary Render. The JT format allows a wider audience to view and interact with models using standard JT viewers.
- Facilitate design reviews and sign offs by making visualisations available to all stakeholders, leading to faster issue resolution and fewer problems in later development stages.

:::note
The exported file does not include parametric data but contains tessellated mesh geometry of your Visionary Render scene. This includes the full hierarchical structure, basic colours, materials, and associated metadata, offering a comprehensive view that can be easily shared and reviewed.

:::note
Manikin export capability is planned for an upcoming release to support ergonomic and process planning applications.

### Licence Type Display

To help you easily distinguish between Developer and Review licences, we now show an `RV` or `DV` indicator in the toolbar. This aims to prevent confusion and potential data loss due to an incorrect version of the licence being used.

### Avatar Name Labels for Collaboration

For quick identification and therefore better collaboration sessions, we've added avatar name labels. This improvement makes interactions more efficient in sessions involving multiple users.

### OpenXR Visibility Mask 

You can now change the size of the visibility mask and also disable it when using external monitors for display. 

### Smoother Navigation in Collaboration Sessions

Improved navigation smoothness in networked VR sessions, optimised for high refresh rate devices.

### Extended Image File Format Support

You can now import a wider range of image formats, including `WebP`, `JPEG 2000 (JP2)`, `JNG`, `JPEG XR (JXR)`, `PBM`, `PGM`, `PPM`, and `PFM`, expanding your options for visual assets.

### Character Controller Improvements 

We've improved the behaviour of the Character Controller with tracking systems and HMDs. Camera movement and collision detection are now based on the position of the tracked user, resulting in a more natural and immersive experience when navigating virtual environments.

:::note
A temporary height difference may occur when switching tracking modes.

### OpenXR / SteamVR Runtime Update

You can now use OpenXR mode with SteamVR's OpenXR runtime, offering greater flexibility and compatibility for users in SteamVR environments.

### Tab Navigation Between Textboxes

You can now navigate between text boxes in the 3D GUI using the Tab key. 

### License Server Update

Security vulnerability patches applied. All users should upgrade to latest version.
