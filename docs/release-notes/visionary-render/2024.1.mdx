# 2024.1

Thank you for downloading Visionary Render 2024.1. This release concentrates on two key areas: 

First, Visionary Render now supports the direct upload of assets and download of complete scenes to and from the Virtalis Hub, without any need for modification or simplification. This release gives you access to a common visualisation framework that is a great advancement in wider enterprise interoperability. 

Second, we have focused on a small set of key issues reported internally and by customers, and we are confident that these changes will be welcomed. 

## Virtalis Hub Integration

The Virtalis Hub is a fully owned and managed solution (on-prem or private cloud) to centrally control visualisation data. Visionary Render remains the rich studio product for power users and this new integration allows for unprecedented ease in sharing scenes across multiple Visionary Render installations or via a web-based client. 

Key benefits to this approach:

- **Integrated Data Sharing:** Visionary Render now allows you to upload or directly stream visualisation data from your instance of the Virtalis Hub.
- **Full Scene Engagement:** You can interact with Virtalis Hub scenes in Visionary Render as usual, with all scripts, GUIs, and other functionalities operational.â€‹
- **Integrated Web Viewer:** Distribute access-controlled scenes via a web browser link across your organisation without the need for specialist hardware or local software installation. The web viewer gives you a no-fuss distribution channel with a basic view of your CAD data, the product tree, as well as core collaboration capability in the browser.
- **Streamlined Data Management:** By integrating our products, it means less fragmented data management and more efficient processes for you. 

:::note
While Visionary Render 2024.1 supports uploading scenes to Virtalis Hub, it currently does not include externally referenced files like point clouds. When opening scenes from the Hub, externally referenced files need to be accessible locally or via a network share. 
:::

:::note
Access to the Virtalis Hub and web viewer are sold separately from your Visionary Render purchase.

### Virtalis Hub: Streaming Download 

Directly stream your project from the Virtalis Hub and all your enhancements (e.g. animated sequences) and decorations (e.g. GUIs, lighting, scripts, manikins) will be preserved just as you saved them. For a seamless and secure experience, every session is authenticated using your Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies set on the Virtalis Hub. Any upload or download from the Hub will prompt a required login for that particular session. 

### Virtalis Hub: Upload

We have introduced a reliable and efficient file upload mechanism, that enables the upload of large files by automatically segmenting them into manageable chunks. If your internet connection becomes unstable, only a small part of the file needs to be present, not the whole thing. 

## Key Changes

### Virtalis Hub Integration

- Upload scenes directly to Virtalis Hub from within Visionary Render.
- Stream scenes from Virtalis Hub to Visionary Render, while maintaining the functionality of decorations and enhancements of scripts, GUIs, manikins, etc.
- Share scenes with others via a web-based viewer, enabling easy access without requiring specialist hardware or software installation.

### Improved Performance

- Experience faster saving for scenes with a large number of models, improving efficiency and productivity.

### HoloLens 2 Reverse Connection

- Say goodbye to manual setup. This update introduces a new, user-friendly way to connect your HoloLens 2 to your PC. Simply scan a QR code with your HoloLens 2, and you'll be up and running in no time. This eliminates the need to manually enter connection details, saving you time and effort.

### OpenXR Improvements

- Enable passthrough mode in Quest Link (developer mode) for a more immersive mixed-reality experience. 
- You can now also adjust background opacity in both the Quest and HoloLens 2 devices for better control over the visibility of the real world behind your virtual content. 

:::note
For passthrough, the base functionality is currently in beta from Meta, and requires a developer account for access. We recommend using a cabled connection with your headset for optimal performance.
