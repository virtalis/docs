# 2023.2

The Beta release of Virtalis Reach marks a substantial leap forward, born from six months of concentrated efforts to enhance CAD data performance and support multiple concurrent user connections. We have re-engineered Reach's architecture from the ground up, directly addressing customer needs for a product that is both scalable and high-performing.

## New Features

This initial Beta release debuts our first-generation rendering system, specifically designed to handle CAD data more efficiently, eliminating the visual limitations experienced in previous versions. While we celebrate this milestone, it's worth noting that our commitment to innovation persists. We are in the advanced stages of further refining this rendering system, and you can anticipate more substantial improvements in the near future.

This Beta release serves three core purposes: to provide a clear indication of the product's direction, to showcase the enhancements in performance and scalability we have achieved, and to gather valuable customer feedback. By engaging with this Beta release, you will experience the progress made, and have the opportunity to provide feedback that will be instrumental in refining Virtalis Reach to better meet your needs. Your interaction and insights are crucial for the ongoing development, and ensuring that the final product is both robust and aligned with your requirements.

## Known Issues and Limitations

This release represents a fundamental rewrite focused primarily on elevating performance and scalability to new heights. Given this focus, the Beta release does not currently offer all the features available in the official release. We want to make it clear that while the Beta release aims to set new standards in performance and scalability, it is not a direct replacement for the official release in its current state.

We recommend using the Beta release for scenarios that require enhanced performance and scalability, and the official release where full feature support is critical. As we head toward an official release with the new performance work, we will continue to evolve the capabilities of the Beta release, informed by performance benchmarks and customer feedback. 

### Known Issues

In ‘open world’ scenes, objects that are very distant from you may get culled - i.e. not appear in view until you move closer. This issue might be associated with the far clip plane in very large open spaces. We are actively investigating it.

A significant database update has been made to facilitate the processing and publishing of large scenes. A known issue arising from this update is that the product tree order may not be preserved accurately. This issue is prioritised for resolution. Additionally, in the official version of Reach, GUI (Graphical User Interface) elements may, in some cases, appear differently from their original arrangement in the scene.

If you are in a scene and click the browser back button, you will be taken to the ‘loading scene’ page. To return to the Scenes page, click the browser back button a second time. Alternatively, you can directly navigate to the Scenes page by clicking the 'Home' link in the middle of the Navigation bar.

### Limitations

The following list is non-exhaustive but indicative of things that will not work or are not supported in the current Beta release:

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Materials and Textures | No support for rendering materials and textures. |
| GUIs | No graphical user interface elements for enhanced interaction within the software. |
| Scripting Support | No ability to incorporate custom scripts for more advanced functionalities. |
| Avatars | No avatars are displayed in collaborative sessions. |
| VR Controllers | No controllers will be visible in VR mode. |
| XR User Interface (XRUI) | No extended reality user interface elements are available. |
| VR Comfort Features | No virtual reality comfort features such as teleportation and snap rotation. |
| Animation | No support for animated sequences. |
