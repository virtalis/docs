# 2025.1

We are pleased to introduce the 2025.1 release of the Virtalis Hub and Web Viewer. This update brings significant enhancements to visualisation capabilities, the interaction modality, and performance optimisation. This delivers a more immersive and efficient experience across all supported devices.

## Performance Improvements

### Client-side Culling System

Our new generation culling system significantly improves performance by intelligently managing which objects are rendered, particularly beneficial for complex scenes with numerous objects. It also helps stabilise collaboration, as it reduces server load so more collaborators can work together with improved performance.

### Enhanced Data Handling

We've made several improvements to how our system processes and manages complex data, allowing the server to host more elaborate scenes with greater efficiency. 

:::note
HMDs have inherent limitations, so this improvement applies to desktop mode only for now.

## New Features

### Metadata Display

Access and view metadata associated with objects directly in the scene, providing deeper insights and contextual information during your visualisation sessions.

### Grab, Move, and Reset Functionality

Our new interaction system now features multiple laser modes that youâ€™ll find invaluable during design review. Toggle between laser off, standard laser, short laser (for grabbing and moving objects with precision), and reset laser (instantly returns manipulated objects to their original positions). Each mode is clearly indicated by an icon displayed just above your controller. This system enables efficient assessment of component fit, quick testing of assembly configurations, and seamless restoration of baseline designs after exploring alternatives.

### Project Revision Access

Navigate through different versions of your projects with full access to revision history, enabling comparison and progression tracking of your visualisations. Design teams can now efficiently review development milestones, identify when specific changes were made, and understand the evolution of complex designs.

### Feature Toggles

Greater control over your experience with basic rules-based controls for key features like the product tree and metadata display, allowing you to customise the interface to your specific needs.

### Texture Support

Textures applied in Visionary Render now appear correctly in the Web Viewer, providing a more accurate and visually rich representation of your models.

### Animation Support

Basic animations created in Visionary Render now function directly in the Web Viewer. Control animations by toggling the new sequences icon in the product tree, bringing your static models to life. Teams can now demonstrate mechanical operations, visualise assembly/disassembly procedures, and showcase moving parts during collaborative reviews. These animations enhance communication of functional design intent, improve stakeholder understanding of complex mechanisms, and help identify potential interference issues during motion sequences.

:::note
This does not apply to animations where the entire hierarchy of a complex assembly is animated, as this will incur a massive performance cost and may degrade your experience of the scene significantly.

## User Experience Enhancements

### Streamlined Interface

The updated interface shows more of your scene with a cleaner collapsible collaboration panel and product tree, putting your content at the forefront of the experience. Double-click anywhere to enter full screen mode, maximising your view of the model and removing distractions.

### Improved Movement Controls

The new movement speed controls gives you more precise navigation control in your virtual environments, with finer granularity options for both novice and experienced users. This is especially useful on mobile devices.

:::note
In VR/AR mode the grip buttons still control the speed as before.
