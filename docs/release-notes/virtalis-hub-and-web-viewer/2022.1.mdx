# 2022.1

We’re pleased to announce the release of Virtalis Reach 2022.1. On top of a number of bug fixes and performance tweaks, we have the following enhancements to announce.

## What's New in This Release?

### Teleport Mode

You can now take advantage of a ‘teleport’ tool to travel greater distances within a visualisation more comfortably. There are two distinct modes within teleport: one supports horizontal movement and the other vertical. See the manual for more information about cycling between the different laser modes.

### Scheduled Publishing Now Displays User Time Zones

Previously, scheduling a publish time would display in UTC, regardless of where in the world you are based. This has now been resolved such that your local time is displayed in the GUI.

:::note
See the [Changelog](../../changelogs/virtalis-hub-and-web-viewer#20221) for a complete list of resolved issues and changes.
