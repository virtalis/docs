# 2022.3

We’re pleased to announce the release of Virtalis Reach 2022.3. The main feature highlight of this release is a ‘grab and move’ capability that you can use when interacting with visualisations using a Head Mounted Display (HMD) and controllers.

## New Features

The grab and move feature adds a more freeform aspect to Virtalis Reach visualisations. By using your HMDs immersive controllers, you can take hold of individual assemblies or parts and move them around in the visualisation. Internal assemblies can be more conveniently inspected, obscured parts scrutinised and a more in depth appreciation for complex products achieved. Grab and move is available whether visualisations are private or collaborative.
