# 2024.3

We are excited to introduce the 2024.3 release of the Virtalis Hub and Web Viewer. This update brings significant enhancements, including improved interactivity with picking capabilities, advanced collaboration tools, workflow automation for optimised performance, and expanded device support and compatibility. 

## What's New in This Release?

### 3D Scene and Product Tree Picking

Select objects directly in the 3D scene or via the product tree. Selected objects are highlighted in user-specific colours, enhancing visibility and collaboration. This new picking functionality allows smoother navigation and object selection across desktop, mobile, and immersive modes without compromising performance.

### Collaborators Panel

A new panel displays all active collaborators in the scene, enhancing awareness and navigation in shared environments. Double-click a collaborator's name to quickly navigate to their location.

In collaborative sessions, if multiple users select the same object, the highlight showing the selection will alternate between the different user colours.

### Background Colour Override

When you set custom background colours for scenes in Visionary Render, these settings are now respected in the Web Viewer, offering greater control over your scene's visual presentation.

### Automatic Project Creation

Streamline your workflow with the new "Create Project" option during asset import. This feature automatically creates and publishes a project with the same name and access settings as the imported asset.

### Configurable Picking in Visionary Render

A new option allows you to disable 3D scene picking for specific projects inside Visionary Render. This provides greater control over interactions in the Web Viewer, especially when you want to restrict selection capabilities. This can also be achieved by using the rules system (see Quick Start guide for more info).

### Expanded Device Support

- **Pico Devices Compatibility:** We've extended support to include Pico devices, broadening the range of hardware options available for immersive experiences.

## User Experience Improvements

### Improved Product Tree Interaction

The product tree now offers three distinct interaction methods:

- **Element Selection:** Select individual elements for detailed viewing.
- **Visibility Toggling:** Show or hide elements to focus on specific parts of the scene.
- **Location Centring:** Centre the view on selected elements for easier navigation.

### Scene Title Display

The scene title is now displayed when a scene is loaded, providing immediate context.

### Improved Keyboard Controls

Developer-specific functions have been moved behind an interface toggle, reducing accidental triggering during normal navigation and interaction in a scene.

### Collaboration Notifications

A new notification system alerts you to important events, such as collaborators joining or leaving a session.
