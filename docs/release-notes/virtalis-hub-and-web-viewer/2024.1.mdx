# 2024.1

Get ready to unlock a smoother, faster, and more collaborative visualisation experience with the 2024.1 release of the Reach web viewer and Virtalis Hub. This release introduces a direct connection between Visionary Render 2024.1 and the Hub, enabling seamless upload and streaming of visualisation data. It also builds upon the solid foundation of the 2023.2 Beta, delivering significant improvements across several key areas.

## What's New in This Release?

### Performance Improvements

#### Improved Import and Publishing

Enjoy faster imports and publishing, leaving you with more time to focus on what matters most.

#### Handle Complex Data with Ease

Our first-generation rendering system in the Reach web viewer tackles intricate CAD datasets, ensuring seamless visualisation.

#### Focused Product Tree

The newly revamped product tree in the Reach web viewer (desktop mode) offers a much-needed speed boost even in fairly complex scenes with thousands of assemblies.

### Collaboration

#### Seamless Hub Integration

Stream visualisations directly into Visionary Render (2024.1) with full functionality of GUIs, scripts, manikins, etc preserved.

#### Centralised Hub, Streamlined Workflow

Use the Hub as your central repository for projects and scenes, upload directly from Visionary Render to the Hub and distribute scenes via the Reach web viewer by just sharing a URL. You can also access them via another Visionary Render instance.

#### Live Sessions

Simplify collaboration with Live Sessions. This new feature makes joining authorised collaboration sessions effortless, especially when using a headset. Forget about cumbersome URL sharing with HMD users. Simply click the "Live Sessions" button and join the active session you need.
