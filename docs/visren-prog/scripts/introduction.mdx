# Introduction

Visionary Render permits you to script behaviour using Lua, which is a high-level programming language that is easy to learn. Visionary Render supports Lua 5.1 (with some extension support for Lua 5.2). 

For an introduction to the language itself, see the book [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/) by Roberto Ierusalimschy. There are also plenty of free tutorials available online.
