# Debug Keys

The Beta release includes several debug keyboard shortcuts to assist us in diagnosing any issues you may experience during the Beta testing period. 

:::note
These will be removed in a future release. 
:::

The following keys are defined:

- 0 - Show boxes for each instance being drawn
- 1 - Show BVH cull bounding test box 
- 2 - Show BVH cull results
- 3 - Perform BVH occlusion culling
- 4 - Show solid debug AABB
- 5 - Show debug AABB
- 7 - Show scene
- 8 - Draw wireframe
- 9 - Force visibility
- C - Toggle detached camera
- F - Show view frustum

If you accidentally enable any of these debug options, you can disable them by pressing the respective key a second time. If you encounter further issues, reload your scene to reset all debug options to their default 'off' setting.

:::note
You can also use the Numpad keys to activate the numerical debug options.
