# User Interface

## Loading Screen

After clicking on a scene in the Scenes page, you will see a loading screen.

Temporary loading screen

Loading times can vary, especially for larger scenes, so with the absence of a progress bar we ask that you please remain patient until your scene fully displays on the screen. Depending on your scene’s complexity and size it may take a short while for assets to download before it becomes usable. Once loaded, you will be placed at the world origin - i.e. x,y,z coordinates (0,0,0). If any errors occur whilst loading your scene you will be returned to the Scenes page.

Note: If your scene has an origin other than (0,0,0) it may appear not to load. A quick workaround is to open Settings (see below) and use the debug animation option to input a specific centre point for your scene. This isn’t ideal though and you will be returned to your original position when you move again. Our recommendation is to re-centre your scene at the origin (0,0,0) and re-publish it.

Once your scene has loaded, you may notice 3 icons at the top-left of your scene:

This icon shows server connectivity and has 3 states:

Green - there is an active connection to the server.

Yellow - the server is initialised but not yet connected to your browser.

Red - the server connection has been lost.

This icon appears and will flash when meshes are being downloaded to your viewpoint in the scene. It will disappear again once all the meshes in your current viewpoint are fully downloaded.

This icon appears when meshes are being sent to your device’s Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to be rendered on the screen.

Scene metrics
There are 2 metrics shown at the top-right of your scene:

Metric

Description

Frames Per Second (FPS)

The frequency that frames are rendered (this gives some insight into the performance of your scene and higher values are preferable). It is split into average (avg), minimum (min), and maximum (max).

Ping

The number below the FPS bar is the milliseconds (ms) that it takes for data to travel from your device to the server and back.

Navigation controls
Desktop
The Beta release of Virtalis Reach maintains the familiar W, A, S, D, Q, and E keys for navigation. You can adjust movement speed with the scroll wheel of your mouse.

Note: The Beta release of Virtalis Reach now also supports navigation with a SpaceMouse.

Tablet and Mobile
If you are on a tablet or mobile device then you can use the following touch controls:

Movement

Description

One-Finger Swipe

Swipe one finger across the screen to look in the direction of your finger. 

Two-Finger Pinch and Spread

‘Pinch’ the screen with two fingers to move your viewpoint forward or spread your fingers apart to move backward.

Two-Finger Vertical Swipe

Place two fingers on the screen and swipe them up and down to move your viewpoint up and down.

Two-Finger Horizontal Swipe

Place two fingers on the screen and swipe them left and right to strafe your viewpoint left and right. 

Note: The touch controls are designed for multi-direction navigation. You can simultaneously use the two-finger vertical swipe to move up or down whilst pinching or spreading to move forward or backward.

Immersive (VR) mode

VR mode button
To enable immersive (VR) mode, open the Virtalis Reach Beta release on your headset’s browser and load a scene. Once the scene has loaded, you'll see a VR mode button at the bottom-right of your screen. Select this to enable immersive mode.

In VR mode you can now finely control your navigation speed using the 'grip' buttons on your controllers. For example, if you are using Quest 2 controllers, you can increase your movement speed by holding down the right 'grip' button and decrease it by holding down the left 'grip' button. This feature allows for more precise and tailored navigation across various devices. 

Note: This interaction method may be refined or changed in the future.

Collaboration
To collaborate, first select and load a scene from the Scenes page. Once the scene is fully loaded, copy the URL from your browser's address bar and share it with your desired collaborators. Invited participants will not face any loading delays; they will be connected to the scene immediately and their session will start downloading and rendering meshes.

Note: The Beta release does not show avatars or controllers - these will be added soon.

Note: If you don’t have permission to join a collaboration session, you will see a blue screen with no geometry in it in the Beta release instead of an error page. This will be fixed in a future release.

Caution: In complex scenes, you may need to wait for the scene to load most of its geometry before sharing the link with others.

Debug panel
There’s a debug panel at the middle-left of your scene. Hover your cursor over it to make it appear. It shows debug information such as the number of draw calls, triangles, and occluders in your current viewpoint. This is mostly intended for internal Virtalis use and will assist us in diagnosing any potential problems you may encounter during the Beta period. This panel also contains a link to the Settings dialog.

Tip: Click on the padlock icon at the top-right to keep the panel in view.

Settings dialog
Click on the ‘Settings’ button at the bottom of the debug panel to open the Settings dialog. This contains various settings for the animated debug camera plus a ‘Backface Culling’ setting. This is enabled by default and optimises performance by removing the rear faces of objects from your scene. Its effectiveness is influenced by how CAD models - such as pipes - are configured or imported into the software. These types of models can appear incorrect with Backface Culling enabled so you may want to disable it if you notice holes in your geometry (but note that this might reduce performance in your scene). 

Note: Backface culling can be safely disabled when using a desktop machine with decent specifications. However, it is advisable to keep this feature enabled when using a standalone head-mounted display (sHMD), as it is primarily designed to enhance framerate performance in sHMD use cases.
