# Getting Started

The importers enable Visionary Render to directly import various CAD and 3D model file formats. They are separate applications that work as plugins. Each importer has its own manual, license, and installer.

## Usage

To access the importers that are installed on your machine, open the Application Menu from the Toolbar and expand the Import menu.

![](/img/user-manual/chapter4/2.jpg)

Now click on an importer to open a file dialog and browse for a supported file to import into your scene. Alternatively, press `Ctrl` + `I` to open a file dialog and browse for all the file extensions supported by the importers (if you don't have any importers installed on your machine, the dialog will give the option to merge a Visionary Render scene instead).

:::note
To import multiple files of the same type at once, select them in the file browser with `Shift` or `Ctrl`.
:::

Press the OK button to start the import with the current importer settings. Alternatively, click on the Show Settings checkbox to configure the importer first.

### Sub-menu

In the Application Menu, each importer has a sub-menu with the following options:

| Option           | Description                                                                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Import           | Import data directly into Visionary Render.                                                              |
| Import and Merge | Import data directly into Visionary Render and merge it into the scene using the current merge settings. |
| Settings         | Open the importer settings dialog.                                                                       |
| Help             | Show the compiled HTML version of this importer’s user manual.                                           |

:::note
Import and Merge is not supported during a network session.
:::

## Settings

The importer settings dialog can be used to configure an importer. It can be shown with the Settings option in the sub-menu or the Show Settings checkbox in the file browser.
