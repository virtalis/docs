# Build Filter Flags

Input and output operation flags that can be passed to the `builderFlags` parameter on [VRLoadTreeEx](../modules/nodes/tree.mdx#vrloadtreeex). 

## Attributes

| Type           | Name           |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| const uint32_t | **[BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_INVALID_ATTRIBS](#buildfilter-allow-invalid-attribs)** <br />Signals that the loader should continue even if it encounters properties that it does not understand.  |
| const uint32_t | **[BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_MISSING_ATTRIBS](#buildfilter-allow-missing-attribs)** <br />Signals that the load operation should populate property values with defaults when the value does not exist in the file.  |
| const uint32_t | **[BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_MISSING_METANODES](#buildfilter-allow-missing-metanodes)** <br />Signals that the loader should continue even if it encounters node types that it does not understand.  |
| const uint32_t | **[BUILDFILTER_MERGE_ALL](#buildfilter-merge-all)** <br />Signals that the load operation should merge all nodes by UUID where possible.  |
| const uint32_t | **[BUILDFILTER_MERGE_ROOTS](#buildfilter-merge-roots)** <br />Signals that the load operation should merge the standard root nodes (e.g. a file containing a Scenes node will load its contents into the existing Scenes tree)  |

## Attributes Documentation

### BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_INVALID_ATTRIBS {#buildfilter-allow-invalid-attribs}

```cpp
const uint32_t BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_INVALID_ATTRIBS = (1 << 4);
```

Signals that the loader should continue even if it encounters properties that it does not understand. 

### BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_MISSING_ATTRIBS {#buildfilter-allow-missing-attribs}

```cpp
const uint32_t BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_MISSING_ATTRIBS = (1 << 0);
```

Signals that the load operation should populate property values with defaults when the value does not exist in the file. 

### BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_MISSING_METANODES {#buildfilter-allow-missing-metanodes}

```cpp
const uint32_t BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_MISSING_METANODES = (1 << 3);
```

Signals that the loader should continue even if it encounters node types that it does not understand. 

### BUILDFILTER_MERGE_ALL {#buildfilter-merge-all}

```cpp
const uint32_t BUILDFILTER_MERGE_ALL = (1 << 2);
```

Signals that the load operation should merge all nodes by UUID where possible. 

### BUILDFILTER_MERGE_ROOTS {#buildfilter-merge-roots}

```cpp
const uint32_t BUILDFILTER_MERGE_ROOTS = (1 << 1);
```

Signals that the load operation should merge the standard root nodes (e.g. a file containing a Scenes node will load its contents into the existing Scenes tree)
