# Build Filter Flags

Input and output operation flags that can be passed to the `builderFlags` parameter on [VRLoadTreeEx](../definitions/group__api__tree.mdx#vrloadtreeex).

| -------------- | -------------- |
| const uint32_t | **[BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_INVALID_ATTRIBS](../definitions/group__api__builder__flags.mdx#buildfilter-allow-invalid-attribs)** <br />Signals that the loader should continue even if it encounters properties that it does not understand.  |
| const uint32_t | **[BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_MISSING_ATTRIBS](../definitions/group__api__builder__flags.mdx#buildfilter-allow-missing-attribs)** <br />Signals that the load operation should populate property values with defaults when the value does not exist in the file.  |

## Attributes Documentation

### BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_INVALID_ATTRIBS

```
const uint32_t BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_INVALID_ATTRIBS = (1 << 4);
```

Signals that the loader should continue even if it encounters properties that it does not understand. 

### BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_MISSING_ATTRIBS

```
const uint32_t BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_MISSING_ATTRIBS = (1 << 0);
```

Signals that the load operation should populate property values with defaults when the value does not exist in the file. 

### BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_MISSING_METANODES

```
const uint32_t BUILDFILTER_ALLOW_MISSING_METANODES = (1 << 3);
```

Signals that the loader should continue even if it encounters node types that it does not understand. 

### BUILDFILTER_MERGE_ALL

```
const uint32_t BUILDFILTER_MERGE_ALL = (1 << 2);
```

Signals that the load operation should merge all nodes by UUID where possible. 

### BUILDFILTER_MERGE_ROOTS

```
const uint32_t BUILDFILTER_MERGE_ROOTS = (1 << 1);
```

Signals that the load operation should merge the standard root nodes (e.g. a file containing a Scenes node will load its contents into the existing Scenes tree)
