# Save/Load Tree I/O Flags

Input and output operation flags that can be passed to the `ioFlags` parameter on [VRLoadTreeEx](../definitions/group__api__tree.mdx#vrloadtreeex) and [VRSaveTreeEx](../definitions/group__api__tree.mdx#vrsavetreeex).

| -------------- | -------------- |
| const uint64_t | **[FILEIO_CHANGED_ONLY](../definitions/group__api__io__flags.mdx#fileio-changed-only)** <br />Signals the file IO to only output Libraries that are changed.  |
| const uint64_t | **[FILEIO_FILE_FORMAT_GUESS](../definitions/group__api__io__flags.mdx#fileio-file-format-guess)** <br />Signals that the save/load operation should determine the file format from the file extension.  |

## Attributes Documentation

### FILEIO_CHANGED_ONLY

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_CHANGED_ONLY = ((uint64_t)1 << 0);
```

Signals the file IO to only output Libraries that are changed. 

### FILEIO_FILE_FORMAT_GUESS

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_FILE_FORMAT_GUESS = ((uint64_t)1 << 35);
```

Signals that the save/load operation should determine the file format from the file extension. 

### FILEIO_FILE_FORMAT_HUMAN

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_FILE_FORMAT_HUMAN = ((uint64_t)1 << 34);
```

Signals that the file should be saved/loaded as a VRText file. 

### FILEIO_FILE_FORMAT_MACHINE

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_FILE_FORMAT_MACHINE = ((uint64_t)1 << 33);
```

Signals that the files should be saved/loaded as a VRNative file. 

### FILEIO_FORCE_SAVE

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_FORCE_SAVE = ((uint64_t)1 << 3);
```

Signals the file IO that we should override the NO_SAVE flag and save anyways. 

### FILEIO_IGNORE_UNSAVED_PROPERTIES

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_IGNORE_UNSAVED_PROPERTIES = ((uint64_t)1 << 7);
```

Signals that values of properties that aren't saved should be ignored when loading. 

### FILEIO_MERGE

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_MERGE = ((uint64_t)1 << 2);
```

Signals the file IO that this call to loadTree() is merging files into the current scene, newly created library nodes will always be flagged as dirty so they are saved with the existing data they have been merged with. 

### FILEIO_MONOLITHIC

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_MONOLITHIC = ((uint64_t)1 << 6);
```

Signals that Library nodes' archive flag should be ignored. 

### FILEIO_NESTED

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_NESTED = ((uint64_t)1 << 1);
```

Signals the file IO that this call to loadTree() is nested inside another. 

### FILEIO_NEW_UUIDS

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_NEW_UUIDS = ((uint64_t)1 << 4);
```

const uint64_t FILEIO_OVERLAY_DOCUMENT = ((uint64_t)1 << 9);
```

Signals that the document should be saved as a system document. 

### FILEIO_SAVE_SIBLINGS_TOO

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_SAVE_SIBLINGS_TOO = ((uint64_t)1 << 32);

Signals that the nodes siblings should be saved. 

### FILEIO_SYSTEM_DOCUMENT

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_SYSTEM_DOCUMENT = ((uint64_t)1 << 8);
```

Signals that the document should be saved as a system document. 

### FILEIO_UUIDS_MUST_EXIST

```cpp
const uint64_t FILEIO_UUIDS_MUST_EXIST = ((uint64_t)1 << 5);
