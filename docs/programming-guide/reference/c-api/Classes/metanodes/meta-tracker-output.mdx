## Detailed Description

```cpp
struct Meta_TrackerOutput;
```

A TrackerOutput represents a link to a particular part of a device, and can send data to it directly. 

These nodes are automatically created, either by the current Desktop Immersion mode, or by a tracker xml configuration loaded at startup (Immersive license feature required for tracker xml support).

These nodes are used to trigger things such as vibration motors or lights on the tracker device
