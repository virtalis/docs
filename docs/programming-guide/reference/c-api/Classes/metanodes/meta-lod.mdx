## Detailed Description

```cpp
struct Meta_LOD;
```

A LOD represents one level of detail of a model, rendered based on its distance from the viewer. It contains [Meta_GeoGroup](../metanodes/meta-geo-group.mdx) children. 

If a Model only has one level of detail, this node is not required unless the model should not be rendered at all outside of a certain distance.

### enum IDX

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Idx_Enabled | | bool - When enabled, the GeoGroups inside are drawn when the view is within the specified InOut distance   |
| Idx_InOut | | vec2 - X = distance from view at which this LOD is active, Y = distance at which the LOD is hidden. e.g. (1,5) is visible when the view is between 1 and 5 metres from the object. Use `Y=-1` for infinity (LOD never disappears)   |
| Idx_RefPoint | | vec3w - Position relative to the model origin point from which to calculate the distance to the view.   |

Property index.
