### enum IDX

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Idx_Enabled | | bool - When enabled, viewport is drawn to the screen   |
| Idx_Rectangle | | vec4f - The viewport bounds, scaled on the screen by the ViewportLayout size. (e.g. layout size `2.0, 1.0`, and child viewport width `1.0` will fill half the screen with the viewport)   |
| Idx_Camera | | link - The camera from which the scene is rendered   |
| Idx_ProjectionMode | | ProjectionMode (int) - The projection mode   |
| Idx_Screen_Mono | | link - (for PhysicalScreen mode) Link to the physical screen for rendering mono   |
| Idx_Screen_Left | | link - (for PhysicalScreen mode) Link to the physical screen for rendering the left eye   |
| Idx_Screen_Right | | link - (for PhysicalScreen mode) Link to the physical screen for rendering the right eye   |
| Idx_FOV | | float - (for other modes) The field of view   |
| Idx_ScreenWidth | | float - (for other modes) The physical width of the screen being displayed on (for stereo separation calculations)   |
| Idx_ScreenOffset | | vec2f - (for other modes) The screen offset   |
| Idx_HMD | | bool - (for other modes) Whether the viewport is being used in a HMD, which makes the viewport calculation affect the camera transform directly, rather than skewing the projection for wall-based setups   |
| Idx_EyeOverride | | EyeOverride (int) - Overrides the eye drawn by this viewport   |
