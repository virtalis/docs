## Detailed Description

```cpp
struct Meta_ConvexDecomposition;
```

A ConvexDecomposition is used to store pre-computed convex decomposition data as part of the scene. 

When a [Meta_Collision](../Classes/struct_meta___collision.mdx) is set to Geometry mode, the specified model is used to generate a convex decomposition, to be used by the collision system. This can be a slow process so this data is cached to avoid unnecessary re-processing every time the scene is loaded.

The contents of this data are not intended to be modified by external APIs.
