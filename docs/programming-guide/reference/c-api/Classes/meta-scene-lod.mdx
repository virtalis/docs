## Detailed Description

```cpp
struct Meta_SceneLOD;
```

A SceneLOD is a LOD that can be applied to Assembly hierarchies rather than individual models. 

Same as a LODNode except its reference point is implicitly the centre of its bounding sphere.

### enum IDX

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Idx_Enabled | | bool - When enabled, the child assemblies are drawn according to the InOut distance   |
| Idx_InOut | | vec2 - X = distance from view at which this LOD is active, Y = distance at which the LOD is hidden. e.g. (1,5) is visible when the view is between 1 and 5 metres from the object. Use `Y=-1` for infinity (LOD never disappears)   |
| Idx_MeasureFromParent | | bool - When true, the reference point is the centre of the parent assembly bounding sphere.   |
