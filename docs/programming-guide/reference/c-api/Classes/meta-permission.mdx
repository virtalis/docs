## Detailed Description

```cpp
struct Meta_Permission;
```

A Permission represents the user's ability to perform a restricted task. 

Permissions are usually granted in response to license checks. Neither the C API nor Lua can create permissions, nor can they be loaded from file. The only thing they can be used for externally is to check their existence. They will not appear in any GUI.
