### enum IDX

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Idx_Addr | | string - (read only) resolvable host name   |
| Idx_Port | | int - (read only) port number   |
| Idx_ProcID | | int - (read only) local process ID   |
| Idx_Authority | | int - Authority level, highest authority is Master, if more than one node of the same Authority exists then Master is decided by earliest CreationTime and then pseudo randomly from NodeID ( vrnet::NetIO::processElectMaster() )   |
| Idx_CreationTime | | int[2] - (read only) 64-bit timestamp at which the User was created, if two Users have the same Authority the one who was created first is Master   |
| Idx_Master | | bool - (read only) Set if this User is the Master   |
| Idx_EnableBeacon | | bool - if True the multicast beacon is active, allowing other VR instances to see this User   |
| Idx_ClusterSlave | | bool - (read only) If True this is a cluster slave node, only the slaves master should interact with this User   |
| Idx_NetRWFlags | | int - (read only) Defines if this user can read/write vrtree changes over the network   |
| Idx_UserName | | string - (read only) username   |



Property index. 

### enum ReadWriteFlags

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Read | VTBIT(0)|   |
| Write | VTBIT(1)|   |
