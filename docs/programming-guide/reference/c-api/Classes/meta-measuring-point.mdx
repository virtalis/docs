### enum @7

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Idx_Enabled | | bool - Enables the measuring point   |
| Idx_LocalPosition | | vec3w - Controls the position of the point relative to its parent   |
| Idx_InitialPosition | | vec3w - Stores the starting position of the measuring point (for movement range tracking)   |
| Idx_MinPosition | | vec3w - Stores the minimum position that this point has been placed at   |
| Idx_MaxPosition | | vec3w - Stores the maximum position that this point has been placed at   |
| Idx_CurrentPosition | | vec3w - Stores the current position of the point in world space (not editable)   |
| Idx_Display | | Internal.   |
| Idx_TrackDeformation | | bool - Whether the measuring point sticks to the surface of a deformable mesh   |
| Idx_CollisionNodePath | | string - The path from the MeasuringPoint's parent to the node that owns the physics body (this is not a link because Manikin's collision nodes aren't saved so the link would be lost when reloaded)   |
| Idx_PartIndex | | int - The index of the part of the physics body that the measuring point is attached to   |
| Idx_TriangleIndex | | int - The index of the triangle of the physics body's part that the measuring point is attached to   |
| Idx_TrianglePoint | | vec3f - The barycentric coordinates of the measuring point within the triangle   |
