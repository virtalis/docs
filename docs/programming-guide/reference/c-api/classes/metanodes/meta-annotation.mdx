## Detailed Description

```cpp
struct Meta_Annotation;
```

An Annotation node is a method of associating information with an object in the scene. 

It can contain multiple viewpoints, comments, and object states, all of which are applied when the annotation becomes active. Generally created by using the Review user interface, annotations can also be data driven, automatically documenting scene objects according to the requirements of the script or plugin writer.

Annotations can also be controlled by the `vrAnnotation*` family of Lua functions.

| Idx_Position | | vec3 - The position of the annotation relative to the `TargetAssembly` transform.   |
| Idx_Rotation | | vec3 - The rotation of the annotation relative to the `TargetAssembly` transform.   |
| Idx_EnterSnapShot | |   |
| Idx_LeaveSnapShot | |   |
