# Application Commands

Visionary Render accepts some high level commands, which can be sent from Lua vrPostCommand.

## Example

Here is a simple example of automating a CAD import / VRNative save operation

```lua
-- define a function to perform a task when a file import is finished
function importComplete(filename, node)
  vrPostCommand("visren_save_document_as", "E:\\VR\\output.VRNative")
  __unregisterCallback("onDocumentImported", importComplete)
end

-- register the function to be called when the onDocumentImported event is fired
__registerCallback("onDocumentImported", importComplete)

-- instruct visionary render to import the specified file (the importer for the file must be installed).
-- note the double backslashes, \ is an escape character in a Lua string, so you need to use two to represent a real \
vrPostCommand("visren_import_data", "file|E:\\Scenes\\tools\\tools.pvs")
```

The parameters accepted by commands are text strings.

## Command Listing

This is a listing of app commands and their parameters.

| Command                         | Description                              | Parameter                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `visren_new_document`           | Starts a new, empty scene                | Any non-empty string disables the "Do you want to save" prompt |
| `visren_open_document`          | Opens a VRNative or VRText file          | An empty string triggers a file browsing dialog. Otherwise, a string in cmd\|val format, specifying the file or directory to open (e.g. file\|C:\\temp\\test.VRNative or directory\|C:\\temp) |
| `visren_show_mergeassistant`    | Displays the merge dialog.               | No parameters                            |
| `visren_close_document`         | Same as `visren_new_document` except it also loads the startup environment | Same as `visren_new_document`            |
| `visren_save_document`          | Saves the scene if it has a name (i.e. has been saved before and modified), otherwise triggers Save-As | No parameters.                           |
| `visren_save_document_as`       | Saves the scene with a specified name, or prompts the user to choose one | cmd\|val format - the command is optional. `val` is the path to the file to save as, `cmd` can be either `monolithic` to save as monolithic, or `finished` to save as finished (as per save-as menu items) |
| `visren_import_data`            | Imports data using installed importer plugins - the imported data appears in whichever scene is currently loaded. | An empty string summons a file browse dialog filtering for all supported importers. Otherwise, string is expected in cmd\|val format - see the supplementary section below this table for the syntax. |
| `visren_import_as_new_document` | Same as above except triggers a `visren_new_document` first. | Same as `visren_import_data`. There is no way to skip the save prompt triggered by the new document command. |
| `visren_import_merge_data`      | Same as above except imported data is merged using the current merge assistant settings. | Same as `visren_import_data`             |
| `visren_export_data`            | Exports data from the scene using installed exporter plugins | Same as `visren_import_data` except `importer` commands are replaced with `exporter` |
| `visren_exit`                   | Exits the application.                   | An empty string triggers the "Do you want to save" dialog. `noquerysave` suppresses this dialog. |
| `visren_cut_selection`          | Cuts the selected nodes to the clipboard | If specified, expects a path to the selection. Otherwise, uses the view that the user last selected nodes in (e.g. if selection was made in Scenes, that selection is cut) |
| `visren_copy_selection`         | Copies the selected nodes to the clipboard | Same as cut                              |
| `visren_paste_selection`        | Pastes the contents of the clipboard as children the current selection of nodes | Same as cut                              |
| `visren_paste_as_sibling`       | Pastes the contents of the clipboard as siblings of the current selection of nodes | Same as cut                              |
| `visren_delete_selection`       | Deletes the selected nodes               | Same as cut                              |
| `visren_clear_selection`        | Clears the selection so nothing is selected | Same as cut                              |
| `visren_show_user_manual`       | Shows user manuals                       | Defaults to showing the Visionary Render user manual. May be given a path to a specific chm file to display that instead |
| `visren_show_about`             | Shows the about dialog                   | No parameters                            |
| `visren_undo`                   | Undoes the last operation                | No parameters                            |
| `visren_redo`                   | Redoes the last operation                | No parameters                            |
| `visren_clear_history`          | Clears the undo stack                    | No parameters                            |

## Import / Export Command

The parameter for the import and export commands is slightly more complex. It could be

- A file to be imported or exported now: `file|C:\temp\myCAD.ext`
- A directory to browse in using filters from all plugins: `directory|C:\temp`
- The name of a plugin, a dialog is displayed with filters from the specified plugin: `importer|myImporter` or `exporter|myExporter`
- Any combination of the above, separated by `*`: `file|C:\temp\myCAD.ext*importer|EXTImporter` (this one imports the specified file using the specified importer)
- An empty string, which displays a dialog using the filters from all plugins

## Callbacks

The example above makes use of `__registerCallback` for `onDocumentImported`.

`__registerCallback(originalFunc, callbackFunc, isSceneFunc)`:

* `originalFunc` - The name of the function to attach a callback to (see Event column below)
* `callbackFunc` - Lua function (object) to call
* `isSceneFunc` - Whether the callback is defined by an Event Handler in the scene. It will be cleaned up when the scene is closed.

The following table lists all other events that can be used with `__registerCallback`.

| Event                        | Callback signature                                       | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `onTreeViewClick`            | `function(view,node)`                                    | Called when a node in the tree is clicked. `view` is the selection group (e.g. `MainSceneTreeView`), and `node` is the node that was clicked. |
| `onTreeViewDoubleClick`      | `function(view,node)`                                    | Called when a node in the tree is double clicked. Parameters are the same as `onTreeViewClick`. |
| `onTreeViewTextDoubleClick`  | `function(view,node)`                                    | Called when the text label of a node in the tree is double clicked. Parameters are the same as `onTreeViewClick`. |
| `onSceneClick`               | `function(view, node, geogroup, material, visual, mesh)` | Called when a node is clicked in the 3D view. `view` and `node` parameters are the same as `onTreeViewClick`, the remaining parameters refer to the specific parts of the node that was clicked. |
| `onTimestepEvent`            | `function(timeDelta)`                                    | Called once every frame. `timeDelta` contains the number of seconds since the last frame. |
| `onDocumentSaving`           | `function(filename)`                                     | Called before a scene is saved as the specified `filename`.  |
| `onDocumentSaved`            | `function(filename)`                                     | Called when the save is completed.                           |
| `onDocumentImporting`        | `function(filename)`                                     | Called before an import is attempted with the specified `filename`. |
| `onDocumentImported`         | `function(filename,node)`                                | Called when the file import is complete. `node` contains the newly imported assembly root node. |
| `onDocumentImportNotStarted` | `function()`                                             | Called when an import fails to start.                        |
| `onDocumentLoading`          | `function(filename)`                                     | Called before a scene is loaded.                             |
| `onDocumentLoaded`           | `function(filename)`                                     | Called when a scene load is complete.                        |
| `onDocumentClosed`           | `function()`                                             | Called when a scene is closed.                               |
| `onDocumentNew`              | `function()`                                             | Called when starting a new scene (before removing any current scene data) |
| `onDocumentClean`            | `function()`                                             | Called after `onDocumentNew`, once the tree is clear and Lua state has been reverted. |

### Unregister

To unregister a callback, use `__unregisterCallback(originalFunc, callbackFunc)`. This requires that the `callbackFunc` can be referenced again (anonymous functions used as callbacks cannot be unregistered using this method).

Removal of all registered scene callbacks can be forced using `__cleanupSceneCallbacks()` as a last resort.

### Custom Callbacks

Since the callback registration stores arbitrary key names against Lua function values, it can also be used for user-defined callbacks, using any string other than the reserved event names above.

The callbacks can be triggered by using `__callback`

`__callback(originalFunc, ...)`:

* `originalFunc` - The name of the function to call, as used in the call to `__registerCallback`
* `...` - Other arguments to forward to the callback function. They are unpacked prior to calling.

For example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="script" label="Script">

```lua
local function hello(name1, name2) 
  print("Hello " .. name1 .. " and " .. name2) 
end

__registerCallback("sayHello", hello, true)
__callback("sayHello", "Bob", "Alice")
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="output" label="Output">

```
Running...
Hello Bob and Alice
Ended.
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
