# Audio

Audio is managed using a buffer for the file and numerous instances of that buffer in the scene providing positional audio.

## AudioBuffer 

### Properties

| Property | Type   | Description                              |
| -------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| File     | string | File path to the audio file. Once loaded, this data is saved in the VR scene. |

### Example

```lua
-- Drag/Drop section BEGINS - Do not edit between BEGINS and ENDS.
local Crash = __Script.dragdrop.Crash
-- Drag/Drop section ENDS

print("File = ", Crash.File)
```

## AudioSound 

### Properties

| Property | Type    | Description                              |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Activate | boolean | When enabled, activates playback of the sound. Value is automatically returned to false, so the sound can be activated multiple times between frames to create overlapping sounds. |
| AudioBuffer | vrnode  | Link to the AudioBuffer node to play     |
| Gain        | number  | Volume of the sound (0.0 - 2.0) - 1.0 is normal volume |
| Relative    | boolean | Audio is positional in the scene         |
| RelativeTo  | number  | Relative to world (0) or local (0) transform of its Assembly parent |
| Directional | boolean | Whether audio is directional (the rotation of the assembly affects perception) |

## Example

```lua
-- Drag/Drop section BEGINS - Do not edit between BEGINS and ENDS.
local CarHorn = __Script.dragdrop.CarHorn
-- Drag/Drop section ENDS

print(CarHorn.AudioBuffer)
print(CarHorn.Gain)
print(CarHorn.Relative)
print(CarHorn.RelativeTo)

-- Set the audio to be positioned relatively to the listener
CarHorn.Relative = true

-- Set Gain to be 0.75
CarHorn.Gain = 0.75

-- Set it to be RelativeTo world
CarHorn.RelativeTo = 0

-- now trigger the audio sound playback
CarHorn.Activate = true
```

## AudioTrack

### Properties

| Property | Type    | Description                              |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| State    | number  | Playback state: stopped (0), playing (1), or paused (2) |
| Loop     | boolean | Whether to repeat the playback when it ends |
| AudioBuffer | vrnode  | Link to the AudioBuffer node to play     |
| Gain        | number  | Volume of the sound (0.0 - 2.0) - 1.0 is normal volume |
| Relative    | boolean | Audio is positional in the scene         |
| RelativeTo  | number  | Relative to world (0) or local (0) transform of its Assembly parent |
| Directional | boolean | Whether audio is directional (the rotation of the assembly affects perception) |

### Example

```lua
-- Drag/Drop section BEGINS - Do not edit between BEGINS and ENDS.
local Audio = __Script.dragdrop.Audio
-- Drag/Drop section ENDS

-- the Audio Assembly has the AudioTrack as a child, called GlassSmash
print(Audio.GlassSmash.AudioBuffer)
print(Audio.GlassSmash.State)

-- Set the audio to be positioned relatively to the listener
Audio.GlassSmash.Relative = true

-- Set Gain to be 0.75
Audio.GlassSmash.Gain = 0.75

-- Set it to be RelativeTo world
Audio.GlassSmash.RelativeTo = 0

-- now trigger the audio track playback
Audio.GlassSmash.State = 1
```
