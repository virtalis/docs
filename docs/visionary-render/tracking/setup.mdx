# Setup

Visionary Render can be configured to be controlled from various tracking systems. A tracking system provides a scene with position and orientation data normally based on your head and hand - but not limited to that. The software can then utilise that data to render the 3D scene to a HMD, ActiveWall or ActiveCube.

Visionary Render can be configured to work with tracking systems such as Polhemus Liberty and Patriot, Intersense IS900, LEAP Motion, Cyberglove, 5DT, Vicon, and ART. It can also communicate with many other devices using VRPN.

It can be configured to work with input devices attached to the tracking system such as Intersense Wand, ART FlyStick, Vicon Apex, Xbox GamePad, and DirectInput Joysticks and GamePads.

For more details on how to configure specific tracking systems, you can [Submit a ticket](https://virtalis.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new) to get help from our support team.

## Tracking Mode

The current tracking mode can be set from the Toolbar, Settings window or via the `-tracking-mode` option on the command-line (see [Command-line](../reference/command-line.mdx#general)).

![](/img/visionary-render/tracking/getting-started/toolbar.png)

Enabling one of the tracking modes requires the device to be connected to your computer and configured per the manufacturer's directions. Switching between modes will automatically connect to, and initialise, the requested device.

Switching between tracking modes automatically reconfigures the view configuration and avatar as required. Note that you can overwrite the default avatar used by each tracking mode via the **Tracking** > **Configuration** > **Avatar** setting.

When using Oculus or SteamVR modes, the Viewport button becomes available to toggle the mirroring of the HMD view on the main desktop display. Turning this off can improve performance in the headset.

### OpenXR

OpenXR is a new immersive mode in 2023.1 that currently supports the following runtimes:

- Oculus
- Windows Mixed Reality
- HTC Vive

:::warning
SteamVR is not currently supported. Other runtimes not listed may still work but we can't make any guarantees.
:::

To use any OpenXR-compatible headset with Visionary Render, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Ensure the headset is turned on and connected to the PC, and OpenXR mode is enabled.

2. Launch Visionary Render in standard desktop mode (i.e. no `-viewConfig` or `-tracker` parameters).

3. Open a scene and select the **OpenXR** option from the tracking menu in the Toolbar.

4. The headset will now initialise.

5. There are no other settings. The application will remember the display mode and above settings at exit and will start up with **OpenXR** mode enabled automatically from now on.

</Steps>

:::tip
If input for your controller or device is awkward or not working, get in touch with us and we can fix it using the bindings in `data/openxr/actionBindings.json`. We have no way to know nor test the proper bindings for all devices in advance.
