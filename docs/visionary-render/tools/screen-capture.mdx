## Video Streaming

Visionary Render can stream video to external devices and control them remotely using a program called ActiveView Light, which is included in the Visionary Render install package.

![](/img/visionary-render/tools/screen-capture/video.png)

:::note
Multiple devices can connect to the same instance of Visionary Render.
:::

### Usage

1. Run Visionary Render on the host machine and enable video streaming by clicking on the ![](/img/visionary-render/tools/screen-capture/stream.png) icon in the Toolbar.
2. Now right-click on the same icon and select Settings… from the drop-down menu to configure video streaming.
3. Copy the Local IP address from the Video Streaming Statistics panel into the Host IP address field. To find any other addresses the machine may have (e.g. for connecting over the internet), run ipconfig from a Windows command prompt. Edit the Port and Password settings if desired or leave them blank. ![](/img/visionary-render/tools/screen-capture/settings.png)
4. Run ActiveView Light from the client machine. This can be found in the Windows start menu. ![](/img/visionary-render/tools/screen-capture/start-menu.png)
5. Enter the host’s IP address, port, and password into the dialogue, then click on the Connect button. Saved connections can be managed with the Save, +, - and Copy buttons at the bottom of the Saved connections panel. ![](/img/visionary-render/tools/screen-capture/activeview.png)
6. Ensure that Display Sync is enabled – it can be found under Settings > Renderer > General. If this is not done, the stream may appear choppy.
7. Configure streaming settings for quality or responsiveness (see the Quality Settings header below).
8. In ActiveView Light, click on the mouse button to allow remote control of the host machine. The X button exits back to the main menu. ![](/img/visionary-render/tools/screen-capture/icons.png)

### Settings

#### Quality Settings

The default streaming settings are set up for medium-quality, high framerate, and low latency. Depending on your network and hardware capabilities, as well as desired result, these may need to be adjusted.

| Setting             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bit Rate            | Controls the target bit rate of the video stream. Higher means a higher quality image at the expense of increased network bandwidth usage. Set to **Auto: Custom** or **Manual** for more control as below. Note that the target bit rate is not always achieved – this can be seen in the **Video Streaming Statistics** panel. Note that unless set to **Manual**, the bit rate of the stream will also depend on the resolution of the window.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Bit Rate Adjustment | When **Bit Rate** is set to **Auto: Custom**, this value between 1 and 100 is a percentage of the maximum quality permitted by the video codec.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Manual Bit Rate     | When **Bit Rate** is set to **Manual**, this is the exact bit rate targeted, regardless of resolution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Max Frame Rate      | Controls the maximum rate at which frames are sent over the network. For a smooth stream, this should be set slightly higher than the actual desired framerate, which itself should be a divisor of your graphics refresh rate (usually 60hz). Good values for this are 65 for a 60hz stream, 35 for a 30hz stream, or 25 for a 20hz stream. As mentioned above, it is imperative that Display Sync is enabled for a smooth stream. If the host machine is unable to render consistently at the desired framerate, a lower one should be chosen, otherwise there will be a knock-on effect to the smoothness of the stream. |
| Frame Size Mode     | Controls the resolution of the stream. If set to **Match Window**, the current Visionary Render display is streamed as-is. Otherwise, the host’s display is adjusted to the desired resolution and that is streamed. The preset values are chosen for optimal performance but selecting **Custom…** allows any fixed resolution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Custom Resolution   | When **Frame Size Mode** is set to **Custom…**, this controls the resolution of the stream.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Scale               | This can be set below 1 to send a lower quality stream while maintaining the resolution set above on the host. Conversely, setting to greater than 1 sends a higher quality stream.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

### ActiveView Light Texture

It is also possible to stream video to a texture in Visionary Render. This is a special node that can be used in place of a normal texture. As well as streaming video from a remote machine, the texture can detect mouse input across the surface it is rendering and convert that back to remote control data. It also provides an interface so that scripting can be used to send data back to the remote server. This could be used to implement a virtual keyboard for example.

![](/img/visionary-render/tools/screen-capture/keyboard.png)

#### Create

1. Ensure that video streaming is enabled in the Toolbar.
2. Create a Library and then an ActiveView Light Texture node (the internal name of this node is NetPlayerTexture).
3. Create a material and link the ActiveView Light Texture to its colour map.
4. Apply the material to the surface that will display the video stream.
5. Set the properties of the ActiveView Light Texture as described below.

#### Properties

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

#### User Input Property

The user input property allows scripts to invoke the player to send remote control data to the server. Changing the property value invokes the player – if the value does not change, in other words the property is set to the value it currently has, then the player will not be invoked, and no new input will be sent. To repeat the input, for example to send a duplicated keypress, the property should be cleared before rewriting the value.

The input string consists of one or more comma separated values. The first 3 values may consist of any or none of “shift”, “ctrl” and “alt”. The final value should be the keyboard character to send. Only one key sequence is supported at a time – to send whole words, write a single character to the input property, then replace it with the next and so forth. This may require a timestep script to allow the NetPlayerTexture actor to respond to the property change events.

:::note
The user input property currently supports sending complete keyboard sequences only – key press, then key release. There is no support to send individual key events or mouse events. Also note that the result at the server will depend on the server’s keyboard map, which may differ from that in use on the player machine.
