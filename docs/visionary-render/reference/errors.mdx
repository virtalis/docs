| The cluster configuration  specified with -viewconfig did not contain a GVXClusterMember for the current machine . | The view config provided for cluster start-up does not specify any cluster members | Ensure there is at least one  element in the view configuration inside the  element, specifying the given IP or hostname, and port number |
| Empty computer name in cluster configuration  | The cluster config does not specify a “ComputerName” attribute on a GVXClusterMember | Ensure the ComputerName attribute is present on each GVXClusterMember element |
| Master must be the first entry in the cluster config | The cluster view config does not specify the master computer first | Ensure the first GVXClusterMember element is that of the master machine in the cluster, and all the slave machines follow |
| Invalid window size: X, Y | A GVXClusterMember in the cluster view config specifies a window size less than zero | Ensure the WindowSize attribute is set to positive values (e.g. “800,600”) |
