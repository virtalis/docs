# Events

Writing Lua scripts can be quite an involved process, so Visionary Render enables you to automatically generate common scripts using Events. An EventHandler can be attached to an Assembly, which then registers interest in certain Events. These events may have a Guard condition attached to them to filter for specific occurrences of these events.

To create an Event, right-click on a node and select **Create** > **Event** from the context menu. A default Key Press Event should be added as in the image above.

## Event

| Event             | Registers             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Activate          | __Other               | Fired when vrActivate is called. The caller of vrActivate can set the value of __Other to whatever is required inside this event. Also triggered by double clicking on some node types in the tree. |
| Break             | __Other               | Fired when two objects stop touching each other in the scene. __Self is this object, __Other is the object that it touched. The guard condition can be set to an Assembly to only fire Break events for that Assembly instead of any node in the scene. Note: you’ll need to add a Collision node to __Self for this event to be fired.                                             |
| Click             |                       | Fired when a 3D GUI item receives a full click (a press followed by a release)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Create            |                       | Fired when the node is created, loaded from file, or when the event script is compiled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Release           |                       | Fired when a 3D GUI item is released.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Toggle            |                       | Fired when a 3D GUI item toggle state changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Touch             | __Other               | Fired when two objects touch each other in the scene. __Self is this object, __Other is the object that it touched. The guard condition can be set to an Assembly to only fire Touch events for that Assembly instead of any node in the scene. Note: you’ll need to add a Collision node to __Self for this event to be fired.                                                     |
| View Deselect     | __Other               | Fired when a node is deselected. This otherwise behaves the same as View Select.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| View Select       | __Other               | Fired when a node is selected. __Other contains the view selection node containing the selection. Note that selecting in the Scenes or Developer views will fire this event twice (once for each view, as the selection is synchronized).                                                                                                                                               |

## Guard

The Guard condition may be:

- A key on the keyboard (modifiers can be used, e.g. `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`).
- A time value in seconds.
- An Assembly.

## Action

If an event occurs and the Guard condition is met, an Action is performed. Examples of typical actions include:

- Activate a Snapshot
- Play a Sequence
- Fly to a Viewpoint
- Change a Material
- Execute a Lua Script 
- Toggle the enabled state
- Play a sound

### Assembly

All the Actions have been dragged and dropped onto the EventHandler property window from the Scenes, Libraries or Developer window. When dragging a node which Visionary Render is not sure what to do with it offers you a choice depending on the type of node that is dropped:

![](/img/visionary-render/3d-view/events/assembly.png)

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Disable | Set the Enabled state of the Assembly to OFF. |
| Enable | Set the Enabled state of the Assembly to ON. |
| Fly To | Fly the view to the Assembly location. |
| Fly To Fit | Fly the view to bounding box of the Assembly. |
| Look At | Rotate the view to look at the Assembly. |
| Toggle | Toggle the Enabled state of the Assembly. |

:::note
The same actions are provided for Lights, Dynamic Sections and Viewpoints.
