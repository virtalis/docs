# Web Browser

Visionary Render supports a modern Chromium‑based web browser that can be attached as a live texture to any object in your scene or to an image panel. This permits you to bring design portals, manufacturing dashboards or documentation directly into your scenes, enabling in‑context decision‑making without leaving XR.
