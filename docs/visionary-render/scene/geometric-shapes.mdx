# Geometric Shapes

Visionary Render enables you to create some common geometric shapes. Right-click on a node (such as an Assembly) in the tree view or scene and select **Create** > **Geometric Shape** from the context menu.

When created on the Scenes node, the shapes appear directly in front of the camera and can be positioned, oriented, and scaled as with any other geometry. When created on an Assembly, their transform will be relative to it. A material is automatically created to go with the geometric shape. Both the Model and Material are accessible from the Libraries tree.

| Shape                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Super-Quadrics

There's also a sub-menu with options for creating various super-quadrics (i.e. 3D parametric objects).
