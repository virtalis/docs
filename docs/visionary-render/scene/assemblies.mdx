# Assemblies

Assembly nodes are the building blocks of Visionary Render scenes. They enable you to position, orient and scale objects in your scene. Each assembly defines a transform in the transform hierarchy, in which transforms have parent-child-sibling relationships. The units are metres and degrees. If your data has been translated from a CAD format, then the scale will generally be unit scale.

## Buttons

| Button        | Description                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reset         | Reset the transform to its default values (i.e. an identity matrix that wonâ€™t transform child nodes in any way). The image above shows a local transform set to identity. |
| Uniform Scale | By default, assemblies scale equally along the x, y, and z axes. Click on this button to switch to non-uniform scaling.                                                   |
| Save          | Save the current transform of this assembly.                                                                                                                              |
| Restore       | Restore the saved transform of this assembly.                                                                                                                             |

## World Transform

![](/img/visionary-render/scene/assemblies/world-transform.png)

This can be changed to transform the Assembly relative to the world origin instead of to its ancestors.

## Apply Transformation

![](/img/visionary-render/scene/assemblies/apply.png)

The Apply Transform drop-down can be used to set a transform without applying it to an Assembly until the **Apply** button is pressed. It can be applied as a Local or World transform, depending on the Transform Mode property.

## Constraints

The **Advanced** rollout contains a property for adding constraints to an Assembly.

### Lock

Prevent the Assembly from being transformed.

### Parent

Prevent the Assembly from being transformed locally.

### Limits

Limit individual components of the Assembly's transform. A TransformLimits node will be automatically created to permit the limits to be configured from the Properties window.

:::note
Transform limits are only applied to user input.

### Look At

The Look at option permits you to select a Target Assembly to direct this Assembly towards. The axis is determined by the model's axis and may need to be adjusted to ensure correct direction. If required, a secondary node can be selected for the up axis.
