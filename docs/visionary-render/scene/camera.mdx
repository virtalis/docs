# Camera

The camera provides your window into the 3D world. It is synonymous to a physical camera in a movie or television program, except that you can control it.

## Controls

You can control the camera with the mouse, keyboard, SpaceMouse, or a tracking device such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. The camera can be configured from the Settings window under `User Interface` > `Navigation`.

### SpaceMouse

The view can also be manipulated with the puck of the SpaceMouse if you have one connected to your machine.

| Action                   | Response                                        |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ![](/img/visionary-render/scene/camera/spacemouse1.png) | Move the view forward or backward in the scene. |
| ![](/img/visionary-render/scene/camera/spacemouse2.png) | Pan the view left or right in the scene.        |
| ![](/img/visionary-render/scene/camera/spacemouse3.png) | Pan the view up or down in the scene.           |
| ![](/img/visionary-render/scene/camera/spacemouse4.png) | Tilt the view to look up or down.               |
| ![](/img/visionary-render/scene/camera/spacemouse5.png) | Swivel the view to look left or right.          |
| ![](/img/visionary-render/scene/camera/spacemouse6.png) | Unassigned.                                     |

The sensitivity of these movements can be configured from the SpaceMouse Properties page. To open this, ensure that the Visionary Render window is in focus, then right-click on the SpaceMouse start menu icon and select **Open 3Dconnexion Properties** from the context menu. Alternatively, press the **Menu** button on your SpaceMouse (if it has one).

You should see a window like the one below. From here, you can configure the overall sensitivity of your SpaceMouse in Visionary Render. To configure the sensitivity of individual puck movements, click on the **Advanced Settings** button.
