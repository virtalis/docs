# Introduction

Visionary Render provides a real-time, interactive, and immersive platform in which to view your CAD data. You can work alone, in a small group, or collaborate with colleagues across the globe to perform design reviews, rehearse training tasks, validate maintenance procedures, or verify assembly and manufacturing processes.

### Key Features

- Create simulations using animations, Lua scripts, and collision detection.
- Import large CAD datasets, whilst preserving hierarchy, naming, and metadata where possible.
- Interact with your data on consumer HMD's such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, plus numerous other tracking systems and input devices.
- Run complex models and simulations across a cluster of machines for improved performance.
- Enhance the visual appearance of your data through rendering effects such as ambient occlusion and high dynamic range imaging.
