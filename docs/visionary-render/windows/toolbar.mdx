# Toolbar

![](/img/visionary-render/windows/toolbar/overview.png)

The Toolbar contains the Application Menu and various buttons like undo/redo and helpers. Most of the buttons represent tools that can be on or off. When activated, these are highlighted in blue. The buttons with a small white triangle at their bottom right contain drop-down menus. Click and hold left mouse button or right-click to show the menu.

The Toolbar can't be closed because it contains the Application Menu, but it can be shown or hidden along with the rest of the GUI by pressing `Alt` + `Z`.

## Buttons

| Button | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/toolbar/undo.png) | Undo the last operation in the application (`Ctrl` + `Z`). To see a description of the action(s) that will be undone, hover the cursor over the button. |
| ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/toolbar/redo.png) | Redo the last operation in the application (`Ctrl` + `Y`). To see a description of the action(s) that will be redone, hover the cursor over the button. |

| ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/toolbar/select.png) | Region select intersected or encapsulated objects in the scene with left-click + drag (`Ctrl` + `1`). This is enabled by default. Drag from left to right to select encapsulated objects, and from right to left to select intersected objects. When the toolbar is narrow, this is combined with the measuring and annotation tools in a drop-down (Note: only one of these can be activated at a time). |

| ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/toolbar/helpers.png) | Select the types of helper objects to display in the scene (light, probe, particle system, etc.) and whether to show all helpers (default), all helper icons, helpers for selected objects only, or no helpers. |
| ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/toolbar/snap-home.png) | Snap selected objects in the scene when dragged near a previous transform (`F4`). |

It permits colours and materials to be observed without having to add lighting to a scene. The drop-down menu contains an option to enable Auto headlight mode. This enables the headlight whenever there is no other light in the 3D scene. An `A` symbol on the headlight button indicates that auto mode is in use. Auto mode is cancelled when the headlight is enabled or disabled manually. The colour and intensity of the headlight can be configured in **Settings** > **Renderer** > **Scene**. Auto headlight mode is enabled by default. |

It has 5 options: <ul><li>**Tracked Mouse Control** - Move the mouse with a tracked hand controller (`Ctrl` + `M`).</li><li>**Avatar Shadows** - Enable or disable avatar shadows.</li><li>**Level Camera** - Keep the camera level when tracking is enabled.</li><li>**Laser** - Show laser pointers on tracked controllers.</li><li>**AR Marker Tracking** - Track AR markers, if supported by the current tracking module.</li></ul> |
