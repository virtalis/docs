# Settings

The Settings window permits you to make changes to the software that persist after exiting - which are known as **User Settings**. It also permits any of these settings to be saved to the current scene - which are known as **Scene Overrides**. The left panel displays settings categories, whilst the right panel displays the pages in each category and the settings themselves.

To open the Settings window, click on the Virtalis button at the top-left of the Toolbar and select **Settings**. It can also be shown or hidden with `F6`.

## Category Panel

The Category panel at the left of the window lists the types of settings within the application. Click on a category to display its settings pages in the Settings panel. You can also navigate the categories with the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys when the panel has keyboard focus.

## Settings Panel

The Settings panel shows a tab for each page in a settings category and any settings within the current page.

There are 5 columns:

| Column         | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name           | Shows the name of a setting. Mouse over the text to see a description of the setting and its script accessor. Right-click on the text to open the context menu. |
| Lock           | Shows a ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/settings/lock.png) icon when a User Setting is locked.                                                                                       |
| User Setting   | Shows the value of a User Setting.                                                                                                                              |
| Scene Override | Shows the value of a Scene Override if present, or a ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/settings/override.png) icon to add a new override.                                                  |
| Delete         | Shows a ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/settings/delete.png) icon when a Scene Override is present to permit it to be deleted.                                                         |

## Scene Overrides

![](/img/visionary-render/windows/settings/scene-overrides.png)

Scene Overrides can be used to save settings - such as a skybox - with your scene. To add a Scene Override, click on the ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/settings/override.png) icon in the Scene Override column or right-click on the name of the setting and select **Add Override** from the context menu.

![](/img/visionary-render/windows/settings/add-override.png)

The Scene Override will take the value of the User Setting initially but can be changed independently to it. When a Scene Override is present, the active setting is highlighted with a **Green** border. This indicates that it is the current value being applied to the application. The inactive setting is highlighted with a **Red** border - its value can still be modified but won't be applied.

:::note
The values of User Settings are automatically saved when the application is exited. The values of Scene Overrides are saved when the scene is saved.
:::

### Lock

You can select to ignore Scene Overrides by locking a User Setting. To lock a setting, right-click on its name and select **Lock** from the context menu. A ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/settings/lock.png) icon will appear to the right of the setting name, and the User Setting will gain a **Green** border if there's a Scene Override to indicate that it is now the active setting.

To unlock a setting, right-click on its name and select **Unlock** from the context menu, or click on the ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/settings/lock.png) icon. Locked settings persist between sessions, so you can permanently ignore Scene Overrides if you wish.

## Buttons

| ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/settings/add-to-gallery.png) | Add all scene overrides to the Gallery.                                                                           |
| ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/settings/additional-options.png) | Show a context menu with options for performing the above operations on settings in the current category or page. |

## Groups

Settings can be added to Groups to permit their values to be captured by Snapshots and applied by Scripts. To add a setting to a Group, right-click on its name and select **Add to Group** from the context menu. Any existing Groups will be listed in the sub-menu alongside the option to create a new Group.

![](/img/visionary-render/windows/settings/new-group.png)

:::note
Because Groups are scene items, only Scene Overrides can be added to Groups. If a setting doesn't already have a Scene Override, one will be automatically created before it is added to the Group.
