# Search

The Search window provides advanced search capabilities that are outside the scope of the quick search found in tree views. It provides two methods of finding nodes - a Name Contains query and an Advanced query.

To open the Search window, click on the Virtalis button at the top-left of the Toolbar and select **Windows** > **Search**. Alternatively, click and hold left mouse button over the Windows menu of the Toolbar and select **Search**. It can also be shown or hidden with `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `F`.

## Name Contains

This text entry box simply finds items with the specified text anywhere in their name. It doesn't support any wildcards.

## Advanced Query

This entry box accepts a search query in the following format:

```
[and|or] [name|type|type.prop] [equals|not|contains] <query>
```

### Examples

To find all the scripts with the word "hello" in their code:

```
EventScript.Code contains hello
```

To find materials whose ambient or diffuse colours are white:

```
StdMaterial.Ambient equals 1,1,1,1 or StdMaterial.Diffuse equals 1,1,1,1
```

To find assemblies with the words "my assembly" in their name:

```
type equals Assembly and name contains “my assembly”
```

To find any assemblies with metadata of a specific value:

```
name equals PART_U_OF_Wand MetaDataString.Value equals KILOGRAM
```

This will find any metadata assemblies of name `PART_U_OF_W` with a value of `KILOGRAM`. The second part of the search on the new line is very important.

You can also search in metadata attribute tables:

The syntax is `attrib <key> <comparator> <value>`, e.g. `attrib TITLE_2 contains viewpoint or attrib DRAWN_BY equals RJB`.

## Filters

The filter checkboxes permit the search to be refined.

| Filter           | Description                                                                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Match case       | Perform a case-sensitive search (i.e. a search for lower case ‘a’ would ignore any capital A’s in the text). |
| Match whole word | Ignore any words that contain the search text in them but have other characters.                             |

## Results

The results area shows a scrollable list of search results. Double-click on a result to select it in the tree view. You can also show multiple results in the tree view by selecting items with `Ctrl` or `Shift`. Right-click on the selection and select one of the options from the context menu.
