# Properties

The Properties window shows the properties of selected nodes. The properties are grouped under rollouts for each type of selected node. The left column shows property and group names - mouse over the text to show a tooltip with a description of a property and its script accessor. The right column displays relevant GUI controls depending on the type of property. It is also used to display custom controls that aren't directly related to a property, like buttons.

To open the Properties window, click on the Virtalis button at the top-left of the Toolbar and select `Windows` > `Properties`. Alternatively, click and hold left mouse button over the Windows menu of the Toolbar and select **Properties**. There are various actions that will cause the Properties window to appear, like right-clicking on a tree view node and choosing **Show Properties**. It can also be shown or hidden with `Ctrl` + `P`.

## Selection History

The ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/properties/prev.png) and ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/properties/next.png) buttons navigate backwards and forwards through the selection history. Click on the drop-down arrow to the right of them to open a list of recently selected nodes.

## Subtree Stats

Click on the ![](/img/visionary-render/windows/properties/info.png) icon to show or hide subtree statistics for the current selection. This generates a table with a total ancestor node count and counts for each type of node.

## Multiselect

Multiple nodes can be shown at once in the Properties window, as in the image below. A drop-down button is displayed for each node type. Some nodes are shown in the Properties view when their parent is selected, as is the case here with the Visual node.

When multiple nodes of the same type are selected, the node name in the drop-down button is replaced by a counter. Any property changes will be applied to all the selected nodes of that type. Properties that differ are highlighted in red. These can still be modified - doing so will set a new value that is shared by the selection.

## Reset to Defaults

To reset the properties of a node to their default values, right-click on a drop-down button and select **Reset All** from the context menu.
