# Installation

Firstly, check that your machine meets the minimum requirements listed in [System Requirements](../reference/system-requirements.mdx). When ready, download the latest version of Visionary Render from the Virtalis Software Portal (if you do not yet have access to this, then please contact us). When the download is complete, run the installer executable and follow the steps below.

<Steps>

1. Close Visionary Render if you have it running then select **Next** to continue.

3. Choose which components to install. There are 2 options:
   - **Visionary Render for Witness** – Permit Visionary Render to be connected to Royal HaskoningDHV's [Twinn Witness](../integrations/twinn-witness.mdx).
   - **MSVC Redistributables for Cluster** – Install MSVC redistributables on the cluster master and share them with the slaves. This prevents you from having to install them on every machine in your cluster.

   Select **Next** to continue.
