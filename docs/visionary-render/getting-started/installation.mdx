# Installation

## MSVC Redistributables

When installing Visionary Render, you may notice the option **MSVC Redistributables for Cluster** on the Components page of the installer.

If you enable this, the installer will add shareable copies of the Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable DLLs to the system the installer is being run on. This allows only the master system to have the necessary version of the required DLLs, and to share them with the slave systems in the cluster. The benefit of using this option is that you no longer have to ensure the correct redistributables are installed on all systems in a cluster, which allows for easier installation and maintenance.

:::note
This option should only be enabled on the master system of a cluster.
